### Repo of Stat 216 Activities ###
#### at Montana State University 

These activities accompany our textbook, [Montana State Introductory Statistics with R](https://mtstateintrostats.github.io/IntroStatTextbook/),
built from much of the OpenIntro and new Introduction to Modern Statistics open source textbooks.
These activities are available as a workbook for purchase (at cost) in the MSU Bookstore.

The "R-C_CoursePack" folder is an archive of the previous Course Pack used prior to 2016.
