9. As far back as medieval times, peppers and other spices have been touted for their potential health benefits, as many possess antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Chili peppers increase the bodyâ€™s ability to break down lipids, which in turn can reduce the risk of hypertension, Type II diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.   Researchers randomly assigned US adult volunteers to either eat one red-hot chili pepper a day for one month or not.  Before and at the end of the study the cholesterol level for each participant was measured.  The researchers hoped to show that eating one red-hot chili pepper a day will reduce cholesterol levels.  They found that of those who consumed at least one red-hot chili pepper a day, 33.6% had lower cholesterol levels at the end of the study.  Of those who did not eat a chili pepper, 21.6% had lower cholesterol levels at the end of the study.  Twenty-five percent of the participants were assigned to eat a red-hot chili pepper each day for one month.

    Let $A$ = participant ate one red-hot chili pepper each day, and $B$ = participant had lower cholesterol levels at the end of the study
