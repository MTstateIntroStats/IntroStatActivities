# Handedness of Male Boxers

## Learning objectives

* Identify the two possible explanations (one assuming the null hypothesis, and one assuming the alternative hypothesis) for a relationship seen in sample data

* Given a research question, construct the null and alternative hypotheses
  in words and using appropriate statistical symbols
  
* Describe and perform simulation-based hypothesis tests for a single proportion

* Interpret and evaluate a p-value

* Use bootstrapping to find a confidence interval for a single proportion

* Interpret a confidence interval

## Terminology review

In today's activity, we will introduce simulation hypothesis testing and confidence intervals for a single categorical variable. Some terms covered in this activity are:

* Parameter of interest

* Null hypothesis

* Alternative hypothesis

* Simulation

* Null distribution

* p-value

* Bootstrapping

* Confidence interval

To review these concepts, see Chapter 5 in your textbook, focusing on Sections 5.1 through 5.3.

## Steps of the statistical investigation process

We will work through a six-step process to complete a hypothesis test for a single proportion.

* **Ask a research question** that can be addressed by collecting data. What are the researchers trying to show?

* **Design a study and collect data**. This step involves selecting the people or objects to be studied and how to gather relevant data on them.

* **Summarize and visualize the data**. Calculate summary statistics and create graphical plots that best represent the research question.

* **Use statistical analysis methods to draw inferences from the data**. Choose an analysis technique appropriate for the data and identify the p-value. In this study, we will focus on using randomization.

* **Communicate the results and answer the research question**. Using the p-value and confidence interval from the analysis, determine whether the data provide statistical evidence against the null hypothesis. 

* **Revisit and look forward** to point out limitations of the study and suggest new studies that could be performed to build on the findings of the study 

## Handedness of male boxers

Left-handedness is a trait that is found in about 10% of the population. Past studies have shown that left-handed men are over-represented among professional fighters. The fighting claim states that left-handed men have an advantage in competition.  In this random sample of 500 male boxers we will see if there is an over-prevalence of left-handed fighters.

```{r echo=TRUE, fig.height=4, collapse=FALSE}
handedness <- read.csv("data/Male_boxers_sample.csv") # Read in data set
handedness_sub <- handedness %>%
  select(Stance) # Select Stance variable
dim(handedness_sub) # Check dimensions of data set are 500 rows x 1 col
```

### Summary statistics review {-}

1.  What are the observational units?

\vspace{0.5in}

2.  What variable are we testing?  Is it categorical or quantitative?

\vspace{0.5in}

3. What type of plot would be appropriate to visually display the data?

\vspace{0.5in}

4. Write out in context the statistic will we calculate to summarize the data.

\vspace{0.5in}

### Ask a research question {-}

5. Identify the research question for this study.

\vspace{1in}

### Design a study and collect data {-}

6. What is the target population for this study?

\vspace{0.5in}

7. Did the researchers use a biased or an unbiased method of selection? Explain your answer.

\vspace{1in}

### Summarize and visualize the data {-}

<!-- ```{r, echo=TRUE, collapse=FALSE} -->
<!-- # Counts for Handedness -->
<!-- # Tally creates a table with a count for each level of the variable -->
<!-- tally(~Stance, data=handedness_sub, margins=T)  -->
<!-- ``` -->

```{r, echo=TRUE, collapse=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
handedness_sub %>% count(Stance)  # Count number in each Stance category
```
8.  Calculate the appropriate summary statistic that represents the research question.  Use appropriate notation.

\vspace{0.5in}

### Use statistical analysis methods to draw inferences from the data {-}

When testing data we must first identify the null hypothesis.  The null hypothesis is written about the parameter of interest, or the true value of interest.  

9.  Write out the parameter of interest for this study. *Hint*: The parameter of interest is the true proportion of....

\vspace{1in}

10.  Using the parameter of interest in question 9, write out the null hypothesis in words.

\vspace{1in}

\newpage
The notation used for a true proportion is $\pi$.  Since this summarizes a population, it is a parameter. When writing the **null hypothesis** in notation we set the parameter equal to the null value, $H_0: \pi = \pi_0$

11. Write the null hypothesis in notation using the null value of 0.1 in place of $\pi_0$.

\vspace{0.5in}

The **alternative hypothesis** is the claim to be tested and the direction is based on the research question.  

12.  Based on the research question from question 5, are we testing that the parameter is greater than 0.1, less than 0.1 or different than 0.1? 

\vspace{0.5in}

13. Write out the alternative hypothesis in words.

\vspace{1in}

14.  Write out the alternative hypothesis in notation.

\vspace{0.5in}

Remember that when utilizing a hypothesis test, we are evaluating two competing possibilities. For this study the **two possibilities** are either...

* The true proportion of male boxers who are left handed is 0.1 and our results just occurred by random chance or
  
* The true proportion of male boxers who are left handed is greater than 0.1 and our results reflect this
  
Notice that these two competing possibilities represent the null and alternative hypotheses.
  
The null distribution is created under the assumption the null hypothesis is true.  In this case, we assume the true proportion of male boxers who are left handed is 0.1 so we will create 1000 different simulations of 500 boxers under this assumption.

Let's think about how to use cards to create one simulation of 500 boxers under the assumption the null hypothesis is true.  Suppose blue cards represents left-handed and red cards represents right-handed.

15.  How many cards total do we need?  How many blue ones?  How many red ones?

\vspace{0.5in}

16.  Next, we would mix the cards together and draw 1 card, write down if it's red or blue, and replace the card.  How many times would we need to repeat this process to simulate our sample?

\vspace{0.5in}

17.  Once we have one simulated sample, what would we calculate and plot on the null distribution?
\vspace{1in}

We will use the computer to simulate a null distribution of 1000 different samples of 500 male boxers, plotting the proportion who are left handed in each sample, based on the assumption that the true proportion of male boxers who are left handed is 0.1 (or that the null hypothesis is true).  

To use the computer simulation, we will need to enter the "probability of success" ($\pi_0$), "sample size" (the number of observational units in the sample), "number of repetitions" (the number of samples to be generated), "as extreme as" (the observed statistic), and the "direction" (matches the direction of the alternative hypothesis).

18.  What values should be entered into the simulation?

\vspace{.2in}
* Probability of success:

\vspace{.2in}
* Sample size:
    
\vspace{.2in}
* Number of repetitions:
    
\vspace{.2in}
* As extreme as:
    
\vspace{.2in}
* Direction (`"greater"`, `"less"`, or `"two-sided"`):

A **point estimate** provides a single plausible value for a parameter. However, a point estimate is rarely perfect; usually there is some error in the estimate. In addition to supplying a point estimate of a parameter, a next logical step would be to provide a plausible range of values for the parameter. This plausible range of values for the population parameter is called a confidence interval. 

We will use bootstrapping to find the 95% confidence interval. 

24.  In your own words, explain the bootstrapping process.

### Communicate the results and answer the research question {-}

When we write a conclusion we answer the research question by stating how much evidence there is for the alternative hypothesis.

29.  Write a paragraph summarizing the results.  Be sure to describe:

* Summary statistic

* P-value and interpretation

* Conclusion (written to answer the research question)

* Confidence interval and interpretation
