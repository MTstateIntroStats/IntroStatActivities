## Week 8 Lab:  Poisonous Mushrooms 

\setstretch{1}

### Learning outcomes

* Given a research question involving two categorical variables, construct the null and alternative hypotheses
  in words and using appropriate statistical symbols.
  
* Describe and perform a simulation-based hypothesis test for a difference in proportions.

* Interpret and evaluate a p-value for a simulation-based hypothesis test for a difference in proportions.

* Interpret and evaluate a confidence interval for a simulation-based confidence interval for a difference in proportions.

### Poisonous Mushrooms

Wild mushrooms, such as chanterelles or morels, are delicious, but eating wild mushrooms carries the risk of accidental poisoning. Even a single bite of the wrong mushroom can be enough to cause fatal poisoning. An amateur mushroom hunter is interested in finding an easy rule to differentiate poisonous and edible mushrooms. They think that the mushroom’s gills (the part which holds and releases spores) might be related to a mushroom’s edibility. They used a data set of 8124 mushrooms and their descriptions. For each mushroom, the data set includes whether it is edible (e) or poisonous (p) and the spacing of the gills (Broad (b) or Narrow (n)).  Is there evidence gill size is associated with whether a mushroom is poisonous?  PLEASE NOTE: According to The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms, there is no simple rule for determining the edibility of a mushroom; no rule like "leaflets three, let it be'' for Poisonous Oak and Ivy. 

Upload and open the R script file for Week 8 lab. Upload and import the csv file, `mushrooms`.  Click on the data set name to find the name of each variable and the level of each variable in the data set.


```r
poisonous <- datasetname # Read data set in
```
