## Lab 1 - Sampling Methods

\setstretch{1}

### Learning outcomes

* Identify biased sampling methods.

### Terminology review
Statistics is the study of how best to collect, analyze, and draw conclusions from data.  Today in class you will be introduced to the following terms:

* Types of sampling bias 

For more on these concepts, read Chapter 1 and Section 2.1 in the textbook.

### General information on labs

On Friday of each week you will complete a lab. Questions are selected from each lab to be turned in on Gradescope.  The questions to be submitted on Gradescope are bolded in the lab.  As you work through the lab have the Gradescope lab assignment open so that you can answer those questions as you go.  Today's activity is Lab 0 in Gradescope for practice submitting as a group.

In the next few weeks we will look at how to summarize data both numerically and graphically.  For now we will focus on sampling methods and the type of sampling bias that may be present.

* Selection bias: a part of the target population is not included or underrepresented in the sample

* Non-response or non-participation bias: part of the already selected sample does not respond or chooses not to participate

* Response bias: survey participant gives an untruthful or misleading response

To help determine the type of bias present, it is helpful to think about the observational units, the sample, and the target population represented by the problem. The **target population** is the group of cases that makes up the population the researcher is interested in. If sampling bias is present, than the sample taken will not be representative of the actual target population.  In these next questions, identify the target population, the sample selected, the variable collected and its type (categorical or quantitative), and the type of bias present.

5. **To determine if the proportion of out-of-state undergraduate students at Montana State University has increased in the last 10 years, a statistics instructor sent an email survey to 500 randomly selected current undergraduate students.  One of the questions on the survey asked whether they had in-state or out-of-state residency.  She only received 378 responses.**

6.  A television station is interested in predicting whether or not a local referendum to legalize marijuana for adult use will pass. It asks its viewers to phone in and indicate whether they are in favor or opposed to the referendum. Of the 2241 viewers who phoned in, forty-five percent were opposed to legalizing marijuana.

7. To gauge the interest in a new swimming pool, a local organization stood outside of the Bogart Pool in Bozeman, MT, during open hours.  One of the questions they asked was, "Since the Bogart Pool is in such bad repair, don't you agree that the city should fund a new pool?"

8. **The Bozeman school district was interested in surveying parents of students about their opinions on returning to in-person classes following the COVID-19 pandemic.  They divided the school district into 10 divisions based on location and randomly surveyed 20 households within each division.  Explain why selection bias would be present in this study design.**

### Take-home messages

1. When creating a data set, each row will represent a single observational unit or case. Each column represents a variable collected. It is important to write each variable as a single word or use an underscore between words.

<!-- 2. There are two types of variables: categorical (groups) and quantitative (numerical measures). -->

<!-- 3. There are three types of bias to be aware of when designing a sampling method: selection bias, non-response bias, and response bias. -->
