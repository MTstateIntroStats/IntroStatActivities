## Activity 2a: Atrial Fibrillation (Study Design)

\setstretch{1}

### Learning outcomes

* Explain the purpose of random assignment and its effect on scope of inference.

* Identify whether a study design is observational or an experiment.

* Identify confounding variables in observational studies and explain why they are confounding.

### Terminology review

In this activity, we will examine different study designs, confounding variables, and how to determine the scope of inference for a study. Some terms covered in this activity are:


* Scope of inference

* Explanatory variable

* Response variable

* Confounding variable

* Experiment

* Observational study

To review these concepts, see Sections 1.3 through 1.6 in the textbook.  

### Study design
The two main study designs we will cover are **observational studies** and **experiments**.  Both the sampling method (which we will cover in next class) and the study design will help to determine the **scope of inference** for a study: To _whom___ can we generalize, and can we conclude causation or only association?  Remember that only in a randomized experiment can we conclude a **causal** (cause and effect) relationship between the explanatory and response variable.

### Take-home messages

1.  The study design determines if we can draw causal inferences or not.  If an association is detected, a randomized experiment allows us to conclude that there is a causal (cause-and-effect) relationship between the explanatory and response variable.  Observational studies have potential confounding variables within the study that prevent us from inferring a causal relationship between the variables.

2.  Confounding variables are variables not included in the study that are related to both the explanatory and the response variables. When there are potential confounding variables in the study we cannot draw causal inferences.
