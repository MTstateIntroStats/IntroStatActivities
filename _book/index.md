# Preface {-}

This coursepack accompanies the textbook for STAT 216: Introduction to Statistics at Montana State University. Each of the activities in this workbook is designed to target specific learning outcomes of the course, giving you practice with important statistical concepts in a group setting with instructor guidance. Bring this workbook with you to class each week, and take notes in the workbook as you would your own notes. A well-written complete workbook will provide an optimal study guide for exams!  The activities are broken into three sections: pre-class, in-class, and after class.  Read through the introduction for each activity and complete the pre-class questions before attending class each week.  In class you will work through the in-class section with your group and instructor.  After class you will complete the out of class part of the activity.
