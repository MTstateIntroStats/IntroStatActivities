# Exam 1 Review

Use the provided data set from the Islands (ExamReviewData.csv) and the Exam 1 Review `R` script file to answer the following questions.  Each adult (>21) islander was selected at random from all the adult islanders.  Variables and their descriptions are listed below.  Music type (classical or heavy metal) was randomly assigned to the Islanders.  Time to complete the puzzle cube was measure before listening to the music and then after listening to music for each Islander.  Heart rate and blood glucose levels were both measured before and then after drinking a caffeinated beverage.

| `City` | Name of City in which the Islander resides |
| `Population` | Population of the City |
| `Name` | Name of Islander |
| `Consent` | Whether the Islander consented to be in the study |
| `Gender` | Gender of Islander (M = male, F = Female) |

| `After_PuzzleCube` | Time to complete puzzle cube (minutes) after listening to assigned music |
| `Education_Level` | Highest level of education completed (note: missing data depicted by missing) |
| `Balance_Test` | Time balanced measured in seconds with eyes closed |
| `Blood_Glucose_before` | Level of blood glucose (mg/dL) before consuming assigned drink |
| `Heart_Rate_before` | Heart rate (bpm) before consuming assigned drink |
| `Blood_Glucose_after` | Level of blood glucose (mg/dL) after consuming assigned drink |
| `Heart_Rate_after` | Heart rate (bpm) after consuming assigned drink |
| `Diff_Heart_Rate` | Difference in heart rate (bpm) for Before - After consuming assigned drink |
