## Week 2 Lab: Study Design

\setstretch{1}

### Learning outcomes

* Explain the purpose of random assignment and its effect on scope of inference.

* Identify whether a study design is observational or an experiment.

* Identify confounding variables in observational studies and explain why they are confounding.

* Explain the effect of sample size on sampling variability

### Terminology review

In this week's lab, we will examine different types of sampling bias and study designs, confounding variables, and how to determine the scope of inference for a study. Some terms covered in this activity are:


* Scope of inference

* Explanatory variable

* Response variable

* Confounding variable

* Experiment

* Observational study

* Types of sampling bias

To review these concepts, see Sections 1.3 through 1.6 in the textbook.  

### Study Design

Each Friday you will complete a lab in class with your group. Questions are selected from each lab to be turned in on Gradescope (one submission per group).  The questions to be submitted on Gradescope are bolded in the lab.  As you work through the lab with your group have the Gradescope lab assignment open so that you can answer those questions as you work through the activity.

### Types of sampling bias. {-}

In today's activity, we will look at sampling and types of bias (selection, non-response, or response).

In these next questions, identify the target population, the sample selected, the variable, and the type of bias present.

1. To determine if the proportion of out-of-state undergraduate students at Montana State University has increased in the last 10 years, a statistics instructor sent an email survey to 500 randomly selected current undergraduate students.  One of the questions on the survey asked whether they had in-state or out-of-state residency.  She only received 378 responses.

2.  A television station is interested in predicting whether or not a local referendum to legalize marijuana for adult use will pass. It asks its viewers to phone in and indicate whether they are in favor or opposed to the referendum. Of the 2241 viewers who phoned in, forty-five percent were opposed to legalizing marijuana.

3. To gauge the interest in a new swimming pool, a local organization stood outside of the Bogart Pool in Bozeman, MT, during open hours.  One of the questions they asked was, "Since the Bogart Pool is in such bad repair, don't you agree that the city should fund a new pool?"

4. The Bozeman school district is interested in surveying parents of students about their opinions on returning to in-person classes following the COVID-19 pandemic.  They divided the school district into 10 divisions based on location and randomly surveyed 20 households within each division.  Explain why selection bias would be present in this study design.

5.  What is the purpose of random selection of a sample from the population?

### Scope of inference {-}

For the next exercises, identify the explanatory variable, the response variable, the study design (observational study or experiment), and the scope of inference (using the following chart).

6. The pharmaceutical company Moderna Therapeutics,  working in conjunction with the National Institutes of Health, conducted Phase 3 clinical trials towards a vaccine for COVID-19 last fall.  US clinical research sites enrolled 30,000 volunteers without COVID-19 to participate. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either the candidate vaccine or a saline placebo.  They were then followed to assess whether or not they developed COVID-19. The trial was double-blind, so neither the investigators nor the participants knew who was assigned to which group.

7. In another study, a local health department randomly selected 1000 US adults without COVID-19 to participate in a health survey.  Each participant was assessed at the beginning of the study and then followed for one year.  They were interested to see which participants elected to receive a vaccination for COVID-19 and whether any participants developed COVID-19.

A **confounding variable** is a variable that is _both_

1. associated with the explanatory variable, _and_
2. associated with the response variable.

When both these conditions are met, if we observe an association between the explanatory variable and the response variable in the data, we cannot be sure if this association is due to the explanatory variable or the confounding variable---the explanatory and confounding variables are "confounded."

8. For each of the studies in questions 6 and 7, determine whether confounding variables could be an issue. If so, identify a potential confounding variable and explain how it meets the definition of a confounding variable.

9. A study published in 2007 by Christopher Johnson, professor of music education and music therapy at the University of Kansas, revealed that students in elementary schools with superior music education programs scored around 20 percent higher in math scores on standardized tests, compared to schools with low-quality music programs.  Explain how school budget could be a potential confounding variable.  Be sure to address how the confounding variable is related to both the explanatory and response variable.

10.  What is the purpose of random assignment of the cases in a study to the explanatory variable groups?

### Effect of sample size {-}

11. Let's return to the Native American Address study.  In today's activity we will select 20 words instead of 10 words at random.

*  Navigate to the “Sampling Distribution of the Sample Mean (Continuous Population)” Art of Stat web applet: https://istats.shinyapps.io/sampdist_cont/.

*  Under “Select Population Distribution”, select “Build Your Own”.

*  Copy and paste the population of word lengths into the applet from the data set provided.  **Only copy column 3 with NO header**. 

*  Select 20 for the sample size.

*  Select 1,000 for the number of samples to simulate drawing from the population.

*  Click “Draw Sample(s)”.

The plot labeled “Sampling Distribution of the Sample Mean” displays the 1,000 randomly generated sample mean word lengths. Sketch this plot below.

12.  Compare the distribution created in question 11 to the one created in question 14 in Activity 2a.  

\rgi Which features are similar?

\rgi Which features differ?

13. Compare the spreads of the plots in question 11 and in question 14 in Activity 2a. You should see that in one plot all sample means are closer to the population mean than in the other. Which plot shows this?

14. Using the evidence from your simulations, answer the following research questions.

\rgi Does changing the sample size impact whether the sample estimates are unbiased? Explain your answer.

\rgi Does changing the sample size impact the variability of sample estimates? Explain your answer
