## Week 2 Lab: Study Design

\setstretch{1}

### Learning outcomes

* Explain the purpose of random assignment and its effect on scope of inference.

* Identify whether a study design is observational or an experiment.

* Identify confounding variables in observational studies and explain why they are confounding.

### Terminology review

In this week's lab, we will examine different types of sampling bias and study designs, confounding variables, and how to determine the scope of inference for a study. Some terms covered in this activity are:


* Scope of inference

* Explanatory variable

* Response variable

* Confounding variable

* Experiment

* Observational study

To review these concepts, see Sections 1.3 through 1.6 in the textbook.
