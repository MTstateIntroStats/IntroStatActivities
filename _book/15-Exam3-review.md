# Semester Review

## Final Exam Review

\setstretch{1}

Use the provided data set from the Islands (ExamReviewData.csv) and the Exam 2 Review `R` script file to answer the following questions.  Each adult (>21) islander was selected at random from all the adult islanders.  Variables and their descriptions are listed below.  Music type (classical or heavy metal) was randomly assigned to the Islanders.  Time to complete the puzzle cube was measure before listening to the music and then after listening to music for each Islander.  Heart rate and blood glucose levels were both measured before and then after drinking a caffeinated beverage.

| **Variable** 	| **Description** |
|----	|-------------	|
| `Island` | Name of Island that the Islander resides on |
| `City` | Name of City in which the Islander resides |
| `Population` | Population of the City |
| `Name` | Name of Islander |
| `Consent` | Whether the Islander consented to be in the study |
| `Gender` | Gender of Islander (M = male, F = Female) |
| `Age` | Age of Islander |
| `Married` | Marital status of Islander |
| `Smoking_Status` | Whether the Islander is a current smoker |
| `Children` | Whether the Islander has children |
| `weight_kg` | Weight measured in kg |
| `height_cm` | Height measured in cm |
| `respitory_rate` | Breaths per minute |
| `Type_of_Music` | Music type (Classical or Heavy Medal) Islander was randomly assigned to listen to |
| `Before_PuzzleCube` | Time to complete puzzle cube (minutes) before listening to assigned music |
| `After_PuzzleCube` | Time to complete puzzle cube (minutes) after listening to assigned music |
| `Education_Level` | Highest level of education completed (note: missing data depicted by missing) |
| `Balance_Test` | Time balanced measured in seconds with eyes closed |
| `Blood_Glucose_before` | Level of blood glucose (mg/dL) before consuming assigned drink |
| `Heart_Rate_before` | Heart rate (bpm) before consuming assigned drink |
| `Blood_Glucose_after` | Level of blood glucose (mg/dL) after consuming assigned drink |
| `Heart_Rate_after` | Heart rate (bpm) after consuming assigned drink |
| `Diff_Heart_Rate` | Difference in heart rate (bpm) for Before - After consuming assigned drink |
| `Diff_Blood_Glucose` | Difference in blood glucose (mg/dL) for Before - After consuming assigned drink |

1. Use the provided Final Exam Review `R` script file and analyze the following research question, "Does drinking a caffeinated drink increase blood glucose levels, on average?" Use before â€“ after as the order of subtraction.
