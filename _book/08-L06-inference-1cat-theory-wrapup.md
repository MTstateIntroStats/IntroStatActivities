11. Interpret the standardized statistic.

12.  Sketch a graph of the normal distribution and how to find the p-value for the theory-based test.

\vspace{1.4in}

Use the following code to find the theory-based p-value.


```r
pnorm(xx, # Enter value of standardized statistic
      m=0, s=1 # Using the standard normal mean = 0, sd = 1
      lower.tail=FALSE) # Gives a p-value greater than the standardized statistic
```

13. Why did you expect that the value of the p-value is similar between theory and simulation methods?
