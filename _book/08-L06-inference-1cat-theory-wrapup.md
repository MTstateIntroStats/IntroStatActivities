## Week 8 Lab:  Errors and Power

\setstretch{1}

### Learning objectives

* Explain type 1 and type 2 errors in the context of a study.

* Explain the power of a test in the context of a study.

* Understand how changes in sample size, significance level, and the difference between the null value and the parameter value impact the power of a test.

* Understand how significance level impacts the probability of a type 1 error.

* Understand the relationship between the probability of a type 2 error and power.

* Be able to distinguish between practical importance and statistical significance.

### Take-home messages

1. The following will increase the power in a hypothesis test:

*   Increase the sample size

*   Increase the significance level

*  Increase the distance between the hypothesized null value and the true parameter value

2.  The significance level of a test is the maximum probability of making a type 1 error.


3.  Very large sample sizes will have very small p-values (your results will be statistically significant), even if the actual difference between the true parameter and the null hypothesis value is very small (the effect is not practically important).


4.  Very small samples sizes can have large p-values (your results will not be statistically significant), but because of low power, it is possible the actual effect is practically important, you were just unable to detect it.
