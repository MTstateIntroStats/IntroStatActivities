This coursepack accompanies the textbook for STAT 216: Introduction to Statistics at Montana State University, which can be found at \url{https://mtstateintrostats.github.io/IntroStatTextbook/}. The syllabus for the course (including the course calendar), data sets, and links to D2L Brightspace, Gradescope, and the MSU RStudio server can be found on the course webpage: \url{https://math.montana.edu/courses/s216/}.
Videos assigned in the course calendar and other notes and review materials are linked in D2L.

Each of the activities in this workbook is designed to target specific learning outcomes of the course, giving you practice with important statistical concepts in a group setting with instructor guidance. In addition to the in-class activities for the course, the coursepack includes reading guides to aid in taking notes while you complete the required readings and videos. Bring this workbook with you to class each class period, and take notes in the workbook as you would your own notes. A well-written completed workbook will provide an optimal study guide for exams!

The activities in this coursepack will be completed during class time on Mondays and Wednesdays. The weekly labs will be completed in class with your group on Fridays. Parts of each lab will be turned in on Gradescope. To aid in your understanding, read through the introduction for each activity before attending class each day.

STAT 216 is a 3-credit in-person course. Students will meet with their instructor and classmates three days per week for 50 minutes. In our experience, it takes six to nine hours per week outside of class to achieve a good grade in this class. By ``good'' we mean at least a C because a grade of D or below does not count toward fulfilling degree requirements. Many of you set your goals higher than just getting a C, and we fully support that. You need roughly nine hours per week to review past activities, read feedback on previous assignments, complete current assignments, and prepare for the next day's class. A typical week in the life of a STAT 216 student looks like:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Prior to class meeting}:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Read assigned sections of the textbook, using the provided reading guides to take notes on the material.
  \item
    Watch assigned videos on that week's content, pausing to take notes and answer video quiz questions.
  \item
    Read through the introduction to the day's in-class activity
  \item
    Read through the week's homework assignment and note any questions you may have on the content.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{During class meeting}:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Work through the in-class activity or weekly lab with your classmates and instructor, taking detailed notes on your answers to each question in the activity.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{After class meeting}:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Complete any parts of the activity you did not complete in class.
  \item
    Review the posted activity solutions and wrap-up videos, and take notes on key points.
  \item
    Finish watching any remaining assigned videos or readings for the week.
  \item
    Complete the week's homework assignment.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Big Idea: Variability is inevitable! We would not expect to get \emph{exactly} 50 heads in 100 coin flips. The statistical question then is whether any differences found in data are due to random variability, or if something else is going on.

\begin{quote}
The larger the difference, the \textbf{less we believe the difference was due to chance.}
\end{quote}

In a data frame, rows correspond to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

and columns correspond to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

How many types of variables are discussed? Explain the differences between them and give an example of each.

\rgs

True or False: A pair of variables can be both associated AND independent.\\
True or False: Given a pair of variables, one will always be the explanatory variable and one the response variable.\\
True or False: If a study does have an explanatory and a response variable, that means changes in the explanatory variable must \textbf{cause} changes in the response variable.

True or False: Observational studies can show a naturally occurring association between variables.

  Observational units or cases
\item
  Variables: categorical or quantitative

How well can humans distinguish one ``Martian'' letter from another? In today's activity, we'll find out. When shown the two Martian letters, Kiki and Bumba, write down whether you think Bumba is on the left or on the right.

\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Were you correct or incorrect in identifying Bumba?
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{steps-of-the-statistical-investigation-process}{%
\subsubsection*{Steps of the statistical investigation process}\label{steps-of-the-statistical-investigation-process}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Steps of the statistical investigation process}

\textbf{Step 1}: The first step of any statistical investigation is to \emph{ask a research question}. In this study the research question is: Can we as a class read Martian? (We will refine this later on!).

\textbf{Step 2}: To answer any research question, we must \emph{design a study and collect data}. For our question, the study consists of each student being presented with two Martian letters and asking which was Bumba. Your responses will become our observed data that we will explore.

\textbf{Observational units} or \textbf{cases} are the subjects data are collected on. In a spreadsheet of the data set, each row will represent a single observational unit.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  What are the observational units in this study?
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{0.2in}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\tightlist
\item
  How many students are in class today? This is the \textbf{sample size}.
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{0.2in}

A \textbf{variable} is information collected or measured on each observational unit or case. Each column in a data set will represent a different variable. Today we are only measuring one variable on each observational unit.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{3}
\tightlist
\item
  Identify the variable we are collecting on each observational unit in this study, i.e., what are we measuring on each student? \emph{Hint}: Your answer to question 1 is the outcome for the variable measured on one observational unit.
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{.8in}

We will look at two types of variables: \textbf{quantitative} and \textbf{categorical} (see Figure \ref{fig:types-of-variables}).

Quantitative variables are numerical measurements that can be discrete (whole, non-negative numbers) or continuous (any value within an interval). The number of pets one owns would be a discrete variable as you can not have a partial pet. GPA would be a continuous variable ranging from 0 to 4.0.

The outcome of a categorical variable is a group or category such as eye color, state of residency, or whether or not a student lives on campus. Categorical variables with a natural ordering are considered ordinal variables while those without a natural ordering are considered nominal variables. All categorical variables will be treated as nominal for analysis in this course.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{images/variables} 

}

\caption{Types of variables.}\label{fig:types-of-variables}
\end{figure}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{4}
\tightlist
\item
  Is the variable identified in question 4 categorical or quantitative?
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{0.3in}

\textbf{Step 3}: Once we have collected data, the next step is to \emph{summarize and visualize the data}.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{5}
\tightlist
\item
  How many people in your class were correct in identifying Bumba? Using the class size from question 3, calculate the proportion of students who correctly identified Bumba.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{center}
$\mbox{proportion} = \frac{\mbox{number of students who correctly identified Bumba}}{\mbox{total number of students}}$
\end{center}

\vspace{0.7in}

The proportion in question 6 is called a \textbf{summary statistic}---a single value that summarizes the data set. It is important to note that a variable is different than a summary statistic. A \emph{variable} is measured on a \emph{single observational unit} while a summary statistic is calculated from a group of observational units. For example, the variable ``whether or not a student lives on campus'' can be measured on each individual student. In a class of 50 students we can calculate the proportion of students who live on campus, the summary statistic. Look back and make sure you wrote the variable in question 4 as a variable, NOT a summary statistic.

Looking at the data set and the summary statistic is only one way to display the data. We will also want to create a visualization or picture of the data. A \textbf{frequency bar plot} is used to display categorical data as a count or frequency. Since our variable has two levels or outcomes, correct or incorrect, we will create two bars---one for each level.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{6}
\tightlist
\item
  Plot the observed class data using a frequency bar plot. Be sure to add a scale to the \(y\)-axis.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.4\linewidth]{images/barplot_martian} \end{center}

We can also visualize the data as a proportion in a \textbf{relative frequency bar plot}. Relative frequency is the proportion calculated for each level of the categorical variable.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{7}
\tightlist
\item
  Plot the observed class data using a relative frequency bar plot. Be sure to add a scale to the y-axis.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.4\linewidth]{images/relative_barplot_martian} \end{center}

\textbf{Step 4}: The next step is to \emph{use statistical analysis methods to draw inferences from the data}. To answer the research question, we will simulate what \emph{could} have happened in our class given random chance, repeat many times to understand the expected \emph{variability} between different ``randomly guessing'' classes, then compare our class's observed data to the simulation. This gives us an estimate of how often (or the probability of) the class's result would occur if students were all merely guessing, allowing us to determine if the data provides evidence that we as a class can in fact read Martian.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{8}
\item
  If humans really don't know Martian and are just guessing which is Bumba, what are the chances of getting it right?
  \vspace{0.3in}

  How could we use a coin to simulate each student ``just guessing'' which Martian letter is Bumba?
  \vspace{.5in}

  How could we use coins to simulate the entire class ``just guessing'' which Martian letter is Bumba?
  \vspace{.5in}

  How many people in your class would you expect to choose Bumba correctly just by chance? Explain your reasoning.
  \vspace{.5in}
\item
  Each student will flip a coin one time to simulate your ``guess'' under the assumption that we can't read Martian. Let Heads = correct, Tails = incorrect. What was the result of your one simulation?
  \vspace{.3in}

  What was the result from your class's simulation? What proportion of students ``guessed'' correctly in the simulation?
  \vspace{.5in}
\item
  If students really don't know Martian and are just guessing which is Bumba, which seems more unusual: the result from your class's \textbf{simulation} or the observed proportion of students in your class that were correct (this is your summary statistic from question 6)? Explain your reasoning.
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{.8in}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{11}
\tightlist
\item
  While your observed class data is likely far different from the simulated ``just-guessing'' class, comparing our class data to a single simulation does not provide enough information. The differences seen could just be due to the randomness of that set of coin flips! Let's simulate another class. Each student should flip their coin again. What was the result from your class's second simulation? What proportion of students ``guessed'' correctly in the second simulation? Create a plot to compare the two simulated results with the observed class result.
\end{enumerate}

\item
  We still only have a couple of simulations to compare our class data to. It would be much better to be able to see how our class compared to hundreds or thousands of ``just-guessing'' classes.

Fill in the following blanks to describe how we would create a simulation of random guessing with 1000 trials (repetitions).

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Introduction to \texttt{R}}

In Stat 216 we will use the statistical package \texttt{R} to analyze data through the IDE (integrated development environment) RStudio. Though it is possible to download \texttt{R} and RStudio on your own computer, we will use this program through the MSU RStudio server: \url{https://rstudio.math.montana.edu/}.

Read through the preliminaries chapter in the textbook and watch the video ``Starting with \texttt{R}'' before completing the following questions.

The RStudio workflow operates best by the use of ``Projects.'' You should create a separate project for each activity or assignment in this course that requires the use of \texttt{R}. To get started with this activity, follow these steps:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Log onto the RStudio server using your NetID and password: \url{https://rstudio.math.montana.edu/}.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Please note: Your netID password expires every 6 months. It is HIGHLY recommended that you reset your netID password BEFORE attempting to login to the Rstudio server. You can reset your netID password in the MSU password portal (\url{https://pwreset.montana.edu/react/}).
  \end{itemize}
\item
  In the top right corner, you will see a dropdown menu next to ``Project'' that currently says ``(None).'' Click on this menu and choose ``New Project.'' (Alternatively, you can click the ``File'' menu in the top left and select ``New Project.'')

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    A ``New Project Wizard'' window should pop up: click ``New Directory,'' then click ``New Project.''
  \item
    Give your project directory a name (e.g., Activity1). \emph{Do not use spaces or other characters in the name.}
  \item
    Click ``Browse'' and choose a location where you would like to save your project (you can create a new folder if desired). Note that this location is on your server account, not on your computer.
  \item
    Leave all other boxes unchecked, and click ``Create Project.'' (Now, if you click on the home icon in the top right, you will see your RStudio account, and the project should be listed under ``Projects.'')
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Download the Martian Alphabet \texttt{R} script file from D2L.
\item
  Click ``Upload'' in the ``Files'' tab in the bottom right window of RStudio. Click ``Choose File,'' and navigate to the folder where the Martian Alphabet \texttt{R} script file is saved. Then click ``Open''; then click ``Ok.''
\item
  You should see the uploaded file appear in the list of files. Click on the filename to open the file.
\end{itemize}

In the Martian Alphabet \texttt{R} script file, highlight the lines of code that starts with \texttt{library} and click ``Run.'' This will load the \textbf{package} (or library) \texttt{catstats} needed for this activity; each package is a collection of \texttt{R} functions. We review a few of these packages here.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Throughout the semester we will use the package \texttt{tidyverse} to allow us to use chaining (see Section 1.7 in the textbook for more on this symbol \texttt{\%\textgreater{}\%}.) Contained in \texttt{tidyverse} is the package \texttt{ggplot2}, used to create graphs in RStudio.
\item
  The package \texttt{mosaic} contains the \texttt{favstats()} function to find summary statistics for quantitative variables.
\item
  We will use the package \texttt{catstats}, starting in Chapter 5 (and in this activity), to create simulations for statistical inference.
\end{itemize}

These packages are already installed in the RStudio server, but you need to use the \texttt{library()} function to call the package into your R environment. We will only use the package \texttt{catstats} for this activity.

The \# sign is not part of the \texttt{R} code.
It is used by these authors to add comments to the \texttt{R} code and explain what each call is telling the program to do.
\texttt{R} will ignore everything after a \# sign when executing the code.

In the Martian Alphabet \texttt{R} script file for the \texttt{one\_proportion\_test()} function arguments, enter your class size (Q3 from the in-class activity) for \texttt{sample\_size} and the number of students who were correct in identifying Bumba (Q6 from the in-class activity) for \texttt{as\_extreme\_as} argument. Highlight lines 3 -- 8 and click run.

Is the distribution created from this code similar to what you saw in class in Q14?

\hypertarget{take-home-messages}{%
\subsection{Take-home messages}\label{take-home-messages}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  In this course we will learn how to evaluate a claim by comparing observed results (classes' ``guesses'' when asked to identify Bumba) to a distribution of many simulated results under an assumption like ``blind guessing.''
\item
  Blind guessing between two outcomes will be correct only about half the time. We can simulate data using a computer program to fit the assumption of blind guessing.
\item
  Unusual observed results will make us doubt the assumptions used to create the simulated distribution. A large number of correct ``guesses'' is evidence that a person was not just blindly guessing.

For this activity, you will read a speech given by Jim Becenti, a member of the Navajo American Indian tribe, who spoke about the employment problems his people faced at an Office of Indian Affairs meeting in Phoenix, Arizona, on January 30, 1947. His speech is below:

\textbf{It is hard for us to go outside the reservation where we meet strangers. I have been off the reservation ever since I was sixteen. Today I am sorry I quit the Santa Fe {[}Railroad{]}. I worked for them in 1912-13. You are enjoying life, liberty, and happiness on the soil the American Indian had, so it is your responsibility to give us a hand, brother. Take us out of distress. I have never been to vocational school. I have very little education. I look at the white man who is a skilled laborer. When I was a young man I worked for a man in Gallup as a carpenter's helper. He treated me as his own brother. I used his tools. Then he took his tools and gave me a list of tools I should buy and I started carpentering just from what I had seen. We have no alphabetical language.}

\textbf{We see things with our eyes and can always remember it. I urge that we help my people to progress in skilled labor as well as common labor. The hope of my people is to change our ways and means in certain directions, so they can help you someday as taxpayers. If not, as you are going now, you will be burdened the rest of your life. The hope of my people is that you will continue to help so that we will be all over the United States and have a hand with you, and give us a brotherly hand so we will be happy as you are. Our reservation is awful small. We did not know the capacity of the range until the white man come and say ``you raise too much sheep, got to go somewhere else,'' resulting in reduction to a skeleton where the Indians can't make a living on it. For eighty years we have been confused by the general public, and what is the condition of the Navajo today? Starvation! We are starving for education. Education is the main thing and the only thing that is going to make us able to compete with you great men here talking to us.}

  Explain how you determined the sampling method used by the class to select words from the American Indian address resulted in selection bias. What did each student need to do?

  \vspace{1.5in}
\end{enumerate}

Suppose instead of attempting to select a representative sample by eye (which did not work), each student used a random number generator to select a simple random sample of 10 words. A \textbf{simple random sample} relies on a random mechanism to choose a sample, without replacement, from the population, such that every sample of size 10 is equally likely to be chosen.

To use a random number generator to select a simple random sample, you first need a numbered list of all the words in the population, called a \textbf{sampling frame}. You can then generate 10 random numbers from the numbers 1 to 359 (the number of words in the population), and the chosen random numbers correspond to the chosen words in your sample.

  Random selection is an unbiased method of selection.
\item
  To determine is a sampling method is biased or unbiased, we compare the distribution of the estimates to the true value. We want our estimate to be on target or unbiased. When using unbiased methods of selection, the mean of the distribution matches our true parameter.
\item
  Random selection eliminates selection bias. Random sampling will not eliminate response or non-response bias however.
\item
  The larger the sample size, the more similar (less variable) the statistics will be from different samples.
\item
  Sample size has no impact on whether a \emph{sampling method} is biased or not. Taking a larger sample using a biased method will still result in a sample that is not representative of the population.

The two main study designs we will cover are \textbf{observational studies} and \textbf{experiments}. In observational studies, researchers have no influence over which subjects are in each group being compared (though they can control other variables in the study). An experiment is defined by assignment of the treatment groups of the \emph{explanatory variable}, typically via random assignment.

For the next exercises, identify the explanatory variable, the response variable, and the study design (observational study or experiment).

  The pharmaceutical company Moderna Therapeutics, working in conjunction with the National Institutes of Health, conducted Phase 3 clinical trials towards a vaccine for COVID-19 last fall. US clinical research sites enrolled 30,000 volunteers without COVID-19 to participate. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either the candidate vaccine or a saline placebo. They were then followed to assess whether or not they developed COVID-19. The trial was double-blind, so neither the investigators nor the participants knew who was assigned to which group.

\hypertarget{atrial-fibrillation}{%
\subsection{Atrial Fibrillation}\label{atrial-fibrillation}}

Atrial fibrillation is an irregular and often elevated heart rate. In some people, atrial fibrillation will come and go on its own, but others will experience this condition on a permanent basis. When atrial fibrillation is constant, medications are required to stabilize the patient's heart rate and to help prevent blood clots from forming. Pharmaceutical scientists at a large pharmaceutical company believe they have developed a new medication that effectively stabilizes heart rates in people with permanent atrial fibrillation. They set out to conduct a trial study to investigate the new drug. The scientists will need to compare the proportion of patients whose heart rate is stabilized between two groups of subjects, one of whom is given a placebo and the other given the new medication.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}

  Response variable:

\newpage

Suppose 24 subjects with permanent atrial fibrillation have volunteered to participate in this study:

Males: Paul, Antonio, Davieon, Chao, Aryan, Jabari, Tong, Andres, John, Liu, Lucas, Rashidi, Shiwoo, Jihoon, Alejandro, Daniel

Non-males: An, Nailah, Jasmine, Ka Nong, Keyaina, Mary, Adah, Sassandra

  \vspace{0.5in}
\item
  To what population should the results of this study be generalized, based on the sampling method?
  \vspace{0.5in}
\item
  One way to separate into two groups would be give all the males the placebo and all the non-males the new drug. Would this be a reasonable strategy? Explain your answer.
  \vspace{1in}
\item
  Could the scientists fix the problem with the strategy presented in question 6 by putting four males into the drug group so that the drug group has 8 non-males and 4 females and the placebo group has 12 males? Explain your answer.
  \vspace{0.5in}
\item
  A third strategy would be to \textbf{block} on sex. In this type of study, the scientists would assign 4 non-males and 8 males to each group. Say they put the four tallest non-males and eight tallest males into the placebo group and the remaining subjects into the control group. Using this strategy, how many males are in each group? What is the sample size of each group? Is the proportion of males the same in the drug and placebo groups?
  \vspace{0.5in}
\item
  \textbf{Assume the scientists used the strategy in question 8 and found that the proportion of patients whose heart rate stabilized is higher in the drug group than the placebo group. Could that difference be due to the sex of the subjects? Explain your answer. Could it be due to other variables? Explain your answer.}
  \vspace{1in}
\end{enumerate}

\newpage

While the strategy presented in question 8 controlled for the sex of the subject, there are more potential \textbf{confounding variables} in the study. A confounding variable is a variable that is \emph{both}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  associated with the explanatory variable, \emph{and}
\item
  associated with the response variable.
\end{enumerate}

When both these conditions are met, if we observe an association between the explanatory variable and the response variable in the data, we cannot be sure if this association is due to the explanatory variable or the confounding variable---the explanatory and confounding variables are ``confounded.''

\textbf{Random assignment} means that subjects in a study have an equally likely chance of receiving any of the available treatments.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{9}
\tightlist
\item
  You will now investigate how randomly assigning subjects impacts a study's scope of inference.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Navigate to the ``Randomizing Subjects'' applet under the ``Other Applets'' heading at: \url{http://www.rossmanchance.com/ISIapplets.html}. This applet lists the sex and height of each of the 24 subjects. Click ``Show Graphs'' to see a bar chart showing the sex of each subject. Currently, the applet is showing the strategy outlined in question 7.
\item
  Click ``Randomize.''
\end{itemize}

In this random assignment, what proportion of males are in group 1 (the placebo group? What proportion of males are in group 2 (the drug group)? What is the difference in proportion of males between the two groups (placebo - drug)?
\vspace{0.25in}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{10}
\item
  Notice the difference in the two proportions is shown as a dot in the plot at the bottom of the web site. Un-check the box for Animate under ``Simulation'' and click Randomize again. Did you get the same difference in proportion of men between the placebo and drug groups?
  \vspace{0.25in}
\item
  Change Repetitions under ``Simulation'' to 998 (for 1000 total). Copy the plot of the distribution of difference in proportions from each of the 1000 random assignments here. Be sure to include a descriptive \(x\)-axis label.
  \vspace{1.25in}
\item
  \textbf{Does random assignment \emph{always} balance the placebo and drug groups based on the sex of the participants? Does random assignment \emph{tend} to make the placebo and drug groups \emph{roughly} the same with respect to the distribution of sex? Use your plot from question 12 to justify your answers.}
  \vspace{0.5in}
\end{enumerate}

\newpage

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{13}
\item
  Change the drop-down menu below Group 2 from ``sex'' to ``height.'' The applet now calculates the average height in the placebo and drug groups for each of the 1000 random assignments. The dot plot displays the distribution of the difference in mean heights (placebo - drug) for each random assignment. Based on this dot plot, is height distributed equally, on average, between the two groups? Explain how you know.
  \vspace{0.5in}
\item
  Suppose there is a genetic component to how well permanent atrial fibrillation responds to medication. The scientists do not know about this gene ahead of time, but if you select Reveal gene? under ``Choose variables'' then change the drop-down menu under Group 2 from ``height'' to ``gene,'' we can see how random assignment impacts the distribution of this gene between the two groups. Explain what happens to the gene variable, in the long run, if random assignment is used to create the two groups. Use the dot plot to justify your answer.
  \vspace{0.5in}
\end{enumerate}

The diagram below summarizes these ideas about confounding variables and random assignment. When a confounding variable is present (such as sex, height, or a gene), and an association is found in a study, it is impossible to discern what caused the change in the response variable. Is the change the result of the explanatory variable or the confounding variable? However, if all confounding variables are \emph{balanced} across the treatment groups, then only the explanatory variable differs between the groups and thus \emph{must have caused} the change seen in the response variable.

\item
  The study design determines if we can draw causal inferences or not. If an association is detected, a randomized experiment allows us to conclude that there is a causal (cause-and-effect) relationship between the explanatory and response variable. Observational studies have potential confounding variables within the study that prevent us from inferring a causal relationship between the variables studied.
\item
  Confounding variables are variables not included in the study that are related to both the explanatory and the response variables. When there are potential confounding variables in the study we cannot draw causal inferences.
\item
  Random assignment balances confounding variables across treatment groups. This eliminates any possible confounding variables by breaking the connections between the explanatory variable and the potential confounding variables.
\item
  Observational studies will always carry the possibility of confounding variables. Randomized experiments, which use random assignment, will have no confounding variables.

In a study reported in Nature (1999, Vol. 399, pp.~113-114), a survey of 479 children found that those who had slept with a nightlight or in a fully lit room before the age of 2 had a higher incidence of nearsightedness (myopia) later in childhood.

In this study, there are two variables studied: \texttt{Light}: level of light in room at night (no light, nightlight, full light) and \texttt{Sight}: level of myopia developed later in childhood (high myopia, myopia, no myopia).

If we wanted to know how many children in our data set were in each level of myopia, we would create a frequency bar plot of the variable \texttt{Sight}. Enter the variable name, \texttt{Sight}, for \texttt{variable} into the \texttt{ggplot} code at line 10 in the \texttt{R} script file. Highlight and run lines 9--15 to create the plot. Note: this is a \textbf{frequency} bar plot plotting counts (the number of children in each level of sight is displayed on the \(y\)-axis).

\item
  When comparing distributions of quantitative variables we look at the shape, center, spread, and for outliers. There are two measures of center: mean and the median and two measures of spread: standard deviation and the interquartile range, IQR = Q1- Q3.
\item
  The median and the interquartile range are robust statistics, meaning that they are not affected by very large or very small values. When we have a skewed distribution the best measure of center is the median and the best measure of spread is the IQR.

\item
  The correlation coefficient must be a positive number.
\item
  Stronger linear relationships are indicated by correlation coefficients far from 0.
\item
  The correlation coefficient is a robust statistic.
\item
  When two variables are highly correlated, that indicates a causal relationship exists between the variables.

You may remember from middle and high school that slope \(=\frac{\mbox{rise}}{\mbox{run}}\).

Using \(b_1\) to represent slope, we can write that as the fraction \(\frac{b_1}{1}\).

Therefore, the slope predicts how much the line will \emph{rise} for each \emph{run} of +1. In other words, as the \(x\) variable increases by 1 unit, the \(y\) variable is predicted to change (increase/decrease) by the value of slope.

  There are three summary statistics used to summarize the relationship between two quantitative variables: correlation (\(r\)), slope of the regression line (\(b_1\)), and the coefficient of determination (\(r^2\)).
\item
  We can use the line of regression to predict values of the response variable for values of the explanatory variable. Do not use values of the explanatory variable that are outside of the range of values in the data set to predict values of the response variable (reflect on why this is true.).

Another summary measure used to explain the linear relationship between two quantitative variables is the coefficient of determination (\(r^2\)). The coefficient of determination, \(r^2\), can also be used to describe the strength of the linear relationship between two quantitative variables. The value of \(r^2\) (a value between 0 and 1) represents the \textbf{proportion of variation in the response that is explained by the least squares line with the explanatory variable}. There are two ways to calculate the coefficient of determination:

~~~Square the correlation coefficient: \(r^2 = (r)^2\)

The Palmer Station Long Term Ecological Research Program sampled three penguin species on islands in the Palmer Archipelago in Antarctica. Researchers took various body measurements on the penguins, including flipper length and body mass. The researchers were interested in the relationship between flipper length and body mass and wondered if flipper length could be used to accurately predict the body mass of these three penguin species.

Upload and import the \texttt{penguins} csv file and the provided \texttt{R} script file for week 5 lab. First we will create a scatterplot of the flipper length and body mass. Notice that we are using flipper length to predict body mass. This makes flipper length the explanatory variable. \textbf{Make sure to give your plot a descriptive title.} Highlight and run lines 1--11 in the \texttt{R} script file. \textbf{Upload a copy of your scatterplot to Gradescope.}

  As far back as medieval times, peppers and other spices have been touted for their potential health benefits, as many possess antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Chili peppers increase the body's ability to break down lipids, which in turn can reduce the risk of hypertension, Type II diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Researchers randomly assigned US adult volunteers to either eat one red-hot chili pepper a day for one month or not. Before and at the end of the study the cholesterol level for each participant was measured. The researchers hoped to show that eating one red-hot chili pepper a day will reduce cholesterol levels. They found that of those who consumed at least one red-hot chili pepper a day, 33.6\% had lower cholesterol levels at the end of the study. Of those who did not eat a chili pepper, 21.6\% had lower cholesterol levels at the end of the study. Twenty-five percent of the participants were assigned to eat a red-hot chili pepper each day for one month.

\(n\) = sample size

\(\pi\) = population proportion

General steps of a hypothesis test:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Frame the research question in terms of hypotheses.
\item
  Collect and summarize data using a test statistic.
\item
  Assume the null hypothesis is true, and simulate or mathematically model a null distribution for the test statistic.
\item
  Compare the observed test statistic to the null distribution to calculate a p-value.
\item
  Make a conclusion based on the p-value and write the conclusion in context.
\end{enumerate}

Parameter: a value summarizing a variable(s) for a population.

Statistic: a value summarizing a variable(s) for a sample.

Sampling distribution: plot of statistics from 1000s of samples of the same size taken from the same population.

Standard deviation of a statistic: the variability of statistics from 1000s of samples; how far, on average, each statistic is from the true value of the parameter.

Standard error of a statistic: estimated standard deviation of a statistic.

Hypothesis test: a process to determine how strong the evidence of an effect is.

\rgi Also called a `significance test.'

Simulation-based method: Simulate lots of samples of size \(n\) under assumption of the null hypothesis, then find the proportion of the simulations that are at least as extreme as the observed sample statistic.

Null hypothesis (\(H_0\)): the skeptical perspective; no difference; no change; no effect; random chance; what the researcher hopes to prove is \textbf{wrong}.

Alternative hypothesis (\(H_A\)): the new perspective; a difference/increase/decrease; an effect; not random chance; what the researcher hopes to prove is \textbf{correct}.

P-value: probability of seeing the observed sample data, or something more extreme, assuming the null hypothesis is true.

\(\implies\) Lower the p-value the stronger the evidence AGAINST the null hypothesis and FOR the alternative hypothesis.

Decision: a determination of whether to `reject' or `fail to reject' a null hypothesis based on a p-value and a pre-set level of significance.

Significance level (\(\alpha\)): a threshold used to determine if a p-value provides enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis or not.

\rgi Common levels of \(\alpha\) include 0.01, 0.05, and 0.10.

Statistically significant: results are considered statistically significant if the p-value is below the significance level.

Confidence interval: a process to determine how large an effect is; a range of plausible values for the parameter; also called `estimation.'

Margin of error: the value that is added to and subtracted from the sample statistic to create a confidence interval; half the width of a confidence interval.

Do young children know the difference between helpful and unhelpful behavior? A study by Hamblin, Wynn, and Bloom reported in Nature was intended to check young kids' feelings about helpful and non-helpful behavior. Non-verbal infants ages 6 to 10 months were shown short videos with different shapes either helping or hindering the climber. As a class we will watch this short video to see how the experiment was run: \url{https://youtu.be/anCaGBsBOxM}. Researchers were hoping to assess: Are infants able to notice and react to helpful or hindering behavior observed in others? In the study, of the 16 infants age 6 to 10 months, 14 chose the \emph{helper} toy and 2 chose the \emph{hinderer} toy.

When performing a hypothesis test, we must first identify the null hypothesis. The null hypothesis is written about the parameter of interest, or the value that summarizes the variable in the population. \emph{For example, in the Martian Alphabet Activity, the parameter of interest is the true proportion of statistic students who would correctly identify Bumba.}

The notation used for a population proportion (or probability, or true proportion) is \(\pi\). Since this summarizes a population, it is a parameter. When writing the \textbf{null hypothesis} in notation, we set the parameter equal to the null value, \(H_0: \pi = \pi_0\).

Remember that when utilizing a hypothesis test, we are evaluating two competing possibilities. For this study the \textbf{two possibilities} are either\ldots{}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The true proportion of infants who choose the helper is 0.5 and our results just occurred by random chance; or,
\item
  The true proportion of infants who choose the helper is greater than 0.5 and our results reflect this.
\end{itemize}

Notice that these two competing possibilities represent the null and alternative hypotheses.

We will now simulate a \textbf{null distribution} of sample proportions. The null distribution is created under the assumption the null hypothesis is true. In this case, we assume the true proportion of infants who choose the helper is 0.5, so we will create 1000 (or more) different simulations of 16 infants under this assumption.

Let's think about how to use cards to create one simulation of 16 infants under the assumption the null hypothesis is true. We will write the response variable outcomes on each card to represent the null hypothesis.

We will use the computer to simulate a null distribution of 1000 different samples of 16 infants, plotting the proportion who chose the helper in each sample, based on the assumption that the true proportion of infants who choose the helper is 0.5 (or that the null hypothesis is true).

  In a hypothesis test we have two competing hypotheses, the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis. The null hypothesis represents either a skeptical perspective or a perspective of no difference or no effect. The alternative hypothesis represents a new perspective such as the possibility that there has been a change or that there is a treatment effect in an experiment.
\item
  In a simulation-based test, we create a distribution of possible simulated statistics for our sample if the null hypothesis is true. Then we see if the calculated observed statistic from the data is likely or unlikely to occur when compared to the null distribution.
\item
  The p-value is the probability of the observed statistic occurring or more extreme if the null hypothesis is true. The farther in the tail of the distribution the observed statistic is, the smaller the probability is (smaller the p-value!). The \textbf{smaller} the p-value, the \textbf{more} evidence the statistic provides \textbf{against} the null hypothesis. (Think carefully about why this makes sense!)
\item
  To create one simulated sample on the null distribution for a sample proportion, spin a spinner with probability equal to \(\pi_0\) (the null value), \(n\) times or draw with replacement \(n\) times from a deck of cards created to reflect \(\pi_0\) as the probability of success. Calculate and plot the proportion of successes from the simulated sample.

In the last class, we found very strong evidence that the true proportion of infants who will choose the helper character is greater than 0.5. But what is the true proportion of infants who will choose the helper character? We will
use this same study to estimate this parameter of interest.

As a reminder: Do young children know the difference between helpful and unhelpful behavior? A study by Hamblin, Wynn, and Bloom reported in Nature was intended to check young kids' feelings about helpful and non-helpful behavior. Non-verbal infants ages 6 to 10 months were shown short videos with different shapes either helping or hindering the climber. Researchers were hoping to assess: Are infants able to notice and react to helpful or hindering behavior observed in others? In the study, of the 16 infants age 6 to 10 months, 14 chose the \emph{helper} toy and 2 chose the \emph{hinderer} toy.

A \textbf{point estimate} (our observed statistic) provides a single plausible value for a parameter. However, a point estimate is rarely perfect; usually there is some error in the estimate. In addition to supplying a point estimate of a parameter, a next logical step would be to provide a plausible \emph{range} of values for the parameter. This plausible range of values for the population parameter is called an \textbf{interval estimate} or \textbf{confidence interval}.

\item
  The goal in a hypothesis test is to assess the strength of evidence for an effect, while the goal in creating a confidence interval is to determine how large the effect is. A \textbf{confidence interval} is a range of \emph{plausible} values for the parameter of interest.
\item
  A confidence interval is built around the point estimate or observed calculated statistic from the sample. This means that the sample statistic is always the center of the confidence interval. A confidence interval includes a measure of sample to sample variability represented by the \textbf{margin of error}.
\item
  In simulation-based methods (bootstrapping), a simulated distribution of possible sample statistics is created showing the possible sample to sample variability. Then we find the middle percent of the distribution around the sample statistic using the percentile method to give the range of values for the confidence interval. This shows us that we are \(X\)\% confident that the parameter is within these values, where \(X\) represents the level of confidence.
\item
  When the null value is within the confidence interval, it is a plausible value for the parameter of interest; thus, we would find a larger p-value for a hypothesis test of that null value. Conversely, if the null value is NOT within the confidence interval, we would find a small p-value for the hypothesis test and strong evidence against this null hypothesis.
\item
  To create one simulated sample on the bootstrap distribution for a sample proportion, label \(n\) cards with the original responses. Draw with replacement \(n\) times. Calculate and plot the resampled proportion of successes.

General steps of a hypothesis test:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Frame the research question in terms of hypotheses.
\item
  Collect and summarize data using a test statistic.
\item
  Assume the null hypothesis is true, and simulate or mathematically model a null distribution for the test statistic.
\item
  Compare the observed test statistic to the null distribution to calculate a p-value.
\item
  Make a conclusion based on the p-value and write the conclusion in context.
\end{enumerate}

Parameter: a value summarizing a variable(s) for a population.

Statistic: a value summarizing a variable(s) for a sample.

Sampling distribution: plot of statistics from 1000s of samples of the same size taken from the same population.

Standard deviation of a statistic: the variability of statistics from 1000s of samples; how far, on average, each statistic is from the true value of the parameter.

Standard error of a statistic: estimated standard deviation of a statistic.

Hypothesis test: a process to determine how strong the evidence of an effect is.

\rgi Also called a `significance test.'

Theory-based method: Develop a mathematical model for the sampling distribution of the statistic under the null hypothesis and use the model to calculate the probability of the observed sample statistic (or one more extreme) occurring.

Null hypothesis (\(H_0\)): the skeptical perspective; no difference; no change; no effect; random chance; what the researcher hopes to prove is \textbf{wrong}.

Alternative hypothesis (\(H_A\)): the new perspective; a difference/increase/decrease; an effect; not random chance; what the researcher hopes to prove is \textbf{correct}.

P-value: probability of seeing the observed sample data, or something more extreme, assuming the null hypothesis is true.

\(\implies\) Lower the p-value the stronger the evidence AGAINST the null hypothesis and FOR the alternative hypothesis.

Decision: a determination of whether to `reject' or `fail to reject' a null hypothesis based on a p-value and a pre-set level of significance.

Significance level (\(\alpha\)): a threshold used to determine if a p-value provides enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis or not.

\rgi Common levels of \(\alpha\) include 0.01, 0.05, and 0.10.

Statistically significant: results are considered statistically significant if the p-value is below the significance level.

Central Limit Theorem: For large sample sizes, the sampling distribution of a sample proportion (or mean) will be approximately normal (bell-shaped and symmetric).

Confidence interval: a process to determine how large an effect is; a range of plausible values for the parameter; also called `estimation.'

Margin of error: the value that is added to and subtracted from the sample statistic to create a confidence interval; half the width of a confidence interval.

The fighting claim states that left-handed men have an advantage in competition. In this random sample of 500 male professional boxers, we want to see if there is an over-prevalence of left-handed fighters. In the sample of 500 male boxers, 81 were left-handed.

The sampling distribution of a single proportion --- how that proportion varies from sample to sample --- can be mathematically modeled using the normal distribution if certain conditions are met.

Conditions for the sampling distribution of \(\hat{p}\) to follow an approximate normal distribution:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Independence}: The sample's observations are independent, e.g., are from a simple random sample. (\emph{Remember}: This also must be true to use simulation methods!)
\item
  \textbf{Success-failure condition}: We \emph{expect} to see at least 10 successes and 10 failures in the sample, \(n\pi≥10\) and \(n(1-\pi)≥10\).
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}

\item
  Is the success-failure condition met to model the data with the normal distribution? Show your work to support your answer. Hint: We don't know the true value of the parameter, \(\pi\), so we use the null value, \(\pi_0\), to check the success-failure condition.
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{1in}

To calculate the standardized statistic we use the general formula

\[
Z = \frac{\text{point estimate} - \text{null value}}{SE_0(\text{point estimate})}.
\]
For a single categorical variable the standardized sample proportion is calculated using

\[
Z = \frac{\hat{p} - \pi_0}{SE_0(\hat{p})},
\]
where the standard error is calculated using the null value:

\[SE_0(\hat{p})=\sqrt{\frac{\pi_0(1-\pi_0)}{n}}\].

Last class we found very strong evidence that the true proportion of male boxers that are left-handed is greater than 0.1. In this activity we will use the same data set to find the theory-based 95\% confidence interval.

Remember from the last activity: Left-handedness is a trait that is found in about 10\% of the general population. Past studies have shown that left-handed men are over-represented among professional boxers. The fighting claim states that left-handed men have an advantage in competition. In this random sample of 500 male professional boxers, we want to see if there is an over-prevalence of left-handed fighters. In the sample of 500 male boxers, 81 were left-handed.

Recall that to use theory-based methods we must check the conditions to approximate the sampling distribution with the normal distribution. From the previous activity, we saw that independence was satisfied as the researchers took a random sample.

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Validity conditions}

To check the success-failure condition to use theory-based methods for confidence intervals, we use \(\hat{p}\) in the calculations since we are not assuming a value for \(\pi\). That is, check that we have at least 10 successes and 10 failures in our \textbf{sample}: \(n\hat{p} \geq 0\) and \(n(1-\hat{p}) \geq 10\).

To calculate a theory-based 95\% confidence interval for \(\pi\), we will first find the \textbf{standard error} of \(\hat{p}\) by plugging in the value of \(\hat{p}\) for \(\pi\) in \(SD(\hat{p})\):

\[SE(\hat{p}) = \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}}.\]

To find the confidence interval, we will add and subtract the \textbf{margin of error} to the point estimate:

\[\text{point estimate}\pm\text{margin of error}\]
\[\hat{p}\pm z^* SE(\hat{p})\]

The \(z^*\) multiplier is the percentile of a standard normal distribution that corresponds to our confidence level. If our confidence level is 95\%, we find the Z values that encompass the middle 95\% of the standard normal distribution. If 95\% of the standard normal distribution should be in the middle, that leaves 5\% in the tails, or 2.5\% in each tail.

In question 1, we found that the success-failure condition was met to use theory-based methods. Here we will use simulation methods to find a 95\% confidence interval for the parameter of interest.

Use the \texttt{one\_proportion\_bootstrap\_CI()} function in \texttt{R} to simulate the bootstrap distribution of sample proportions and calculate a confidence interval. Using the provided \texttt{R} script file, fill in the values/words for each \texttt{xx} in the one proportion bootstrap confidence interval (CI) code to create a bootstrap distribution with 1000 simulations. Make sure to run the library(catstats) function before running the one\_proportion\_bootstrap\_CI function.

\(\pi\) = population proportion

General steps of a hypothesis test:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Frame the research question in terms of hypotheses.
\item
  Collect and summarize data using a test statistic.
\item
  Assume the null hypothesis is true, and simulate or mathematically model a null distribution for the test statistic.
\item
  Compare the observed test (standardized) statistic to the null distribution to calculate a p-value.
\item
  Make a conclusion based on the p-value and write the conclusion in context.
\end{enumerate}

Parameter: a value summarizing a variable(s) for a population.

Statistic: a value summarizing a variable(s) for a sample.

Sampling distribution: plot of statistics from 1000s of samples of the same size taken from the same population.

Standard deviation of a statistic: the variability of statistics from 1000s of samples; how far, on average, each statistic is from the true value of the parameter.

Standard error of a statistic: estimated standard deviation of a statistic.

Hypothesis test: a process to determine how strong the evidence of an effect is.

\rgi Also called a `significance test.'

Simulation-based method: Simulate lots of samples of size \(n\) under assumption of the null hypothesis, then find the proportion of the simulations that are at least as extreme as the observed sample statistic.

Null hypothesis (\(H_0\)): the skeptical perspective; no difference; no change; no effect; random chance; what the researcher hopes to prove is \textbf{wrong}.

Alternative hypothesis (\(H_A\)): the new perspective; a difference/increase/decrease; an effect; not random chance; what the researcher hopes to prove is \textbf{correct}.

Null value: the value of the parameter when we assume the null hypothesis is true (labeled as \(parameter_0\)).

Null distribution: the simulated or modeled distribution of statistics (sampling distribution) we would expect to occur if the null hypothesis is true.

P-value: probability of seeing the observed sample data, or something more extreme, assuming the null hypothesis is true.

\(\implies\) Lower the p-value the stronger the evidence AGAINST the null hypothesis and FOR the alternative hypothesis.

Decision: a determination of whether to `reject' or `fail to reject' a null hypothesis based on a p-value and a pre-set level of significance.

Significance level (\(\alpha\)): a threshold used to determine if a p-value provides enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis or not.

\rgi Common levels of \(\alpha\) include 0.01, 0.05, and 0.10.

Statistically significant: results are considered statistically significant if the p-value is below the significance level.

Confidence interval: a process to determine how large an effect is; a range of plausible values for the parameter. Also called `estimation.'

Margin of error: the value that is added to and subtracted from the sample statistic to create a confidence interval; half the width of a confidence interval.

Bootstrapping: the process of drawing with replacement \(n\) times from the original sample.

Bootstrapped resample: a random sample of size \(n\) from the original sample, selected with replacement.

Bootstrapped statistic: the statistic recorded from the bootstrapped resample.

Confidence level: how confident we are that the confidence interval will capture the parameter.

Researchers at the Princeton University wanted to investigate influences on behavior. The researchers randomly selected 67 students from the Princeton Theological Seminary to participate in a study. Only 47 students chose to participate in the study, and the data below includes 40 of those students (7 students were removed from the study for various reasons). As all participants were theology majors planning a career as a preacher, the expectation was that all would have a similar disposition when it comes to helping behavior. Each student was then shown a 5-minute presentation on the Good Samaritan, a parable in the Bible which emphasizes the importance of helping others. After the presentation, the students were told they needed to give a talk on the Good Samaritan parable at a building across campus. Half the students were told they were late for the presentation; the other half told they could take their time getting across campus (the condition was randomly assigned). On the way between buildings, an actor pretending to be a homeless person in distress asked the student for help. The researchers recorded whether the student helped the actor or not. The results of the study are shown in the table below. Do these data provide evidence that those in a hurry will be less likely to help people in need in this situation? Use the order of subtraction hurry -- no hurry.

To create the null distribution of differences in sample proportions, we will use the \texttt{two\_proportion\_test()} function in \texttt{R} (in the \texttt{catstats} package). We will need to enter the response variable name and the explanatory variable name for the formula, the data set name (identified above as \texttt{good}), the outcome for the explanatory variable that is first in subtraction, number of repetitions, the outcome for the response variable that is a success (what the numerator counts when calculating a sample proportion), and the direction of the alternative hypothesis.

In the last activity, we found a small p-value for the hypothesis test for a difference in proportions. There was very strong evidence that those in a hurry will be less likely to help people in need. In today's activity, we will estimate the difference in true proportion of people who will help others for those in the hurry condition and those not in the hurry condition by finding a confidence interval.

Researchers at the Princeton University wanted to investigate influences on behavior. The researchers randomly selected 67 students from the Princeton Theological Seminary to participate in a study. Only 47 students chose to participate in the study, and the data below includes 40 of those students (7 students were removed from the study for various reasons). As all participants were theology majors planning a career as a preacher, the expectation was that all would have a similar disposition when it comes to helping behavior. Each student was then shown a 5-minute presentation on the Good Samaritan, a parable in the Bible which emphasizes the importance of helping others. After the presentation, the students were told they needed to give a talk on the Good Samaritan parable at a building across campus. Half the students were told they were late for the presentation; the other half told they could take their time getting across campus (the condition was randomly assigned). On the way between buildings, an actor pretending to be a homeless person in distress asked the student for help. The researchers recorded whether the student helped the actor or not. The results of the study are shown in the table below. Do these data provide evidence that those in a hurry will be less likely to help people in need in this situation? Use the order of subtraction hurry -- no hurry.

Recall from a previous activity, hypothesis tests are not flawless. In a hypothesis test, there are two competing hypotheses: the null and alternative. We make a decision about which might be true, but we may choose incorrectly.

\begin{table}
\caption{Four different possible scenarios for hypothesis test decisions.}
\centering
\begin{tabular}[h]{ll|cc}
\hline
 & &  \multicolumn{2}{c}{\textbf{Test conclusion}} \\

Shown in Table \ref{tab:errors}, a \textbf{Type 1 Error} happens when we reject the null hypothesis when \(H_0\) is actually true. A \textbf{Type 2 Error} happens when we fail to reject the null hypothesis when the alternative is actually true.

According to the \emph{Washington Post} ``States with higher vaccination rates now have markedly fewer coronavirus cases, as infections are dropping in places where most residents have been immunized and are rising in many places people have not.'' In this article they found that there are differences in infection rates for different counties within a specific state. To check this claim, a random sample of 125 counties from different states was assessed. Vaccination rates were found for each county and broken up into groups, high and low, based on a vaccination rate of 40\%. Those counties with a vaccination rate of greater than 40\% was considered a high vaccination rate. The 2nd variable measured on these counties was whether the number of cases per 100,000 residents was less than or greater than 4.25, the national rate at that time. Researchers want to assess if counties with a high vaccination rate are more likely to have lower coronavirus cases.

General steps of a hypothesis test:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Frame the research question in terms of hypotheses.
\item
  Collect and summarize data using a test statistic.
\item
  Assume the null hypothesis is true, and simulate or mathematically model a null distribution for the test statistic.
\item
  Compare the observed test (standardized) statistic to the null distribution to calculate a p-value.
\item
  Make a conclusion based on the p-value and write the conclusion in context.
\end{enumerate}

Parameter: a value summarizing a variable(s) for a population.

Statistic: a value summarizing a variable(s) for a sample.

Sampling distribution: plot of statistics from 1000s of samples of the same size taken from the same population.

Standard deviation of a statistic: the variability of statistics from 1000s of samples; how far, on average, each statistic is from the true value of the parameter.

Standard error of a statistic: estimated standard deviation of a statistic.

Hypothesis test: a process to determine how strong the evidence of an effect is.

\rgi Also called a `significance test.'

Theory-based method: Develop a mathematical model for the sampling distribution of the statistic under the null hypothesis and use the model to calculate the probability of the observed sample statistic (or one more extreme) occurring.

Null hypothesis (\(H_0\)): the skeptical perspective; no difference; no change; no effect; random chance; what the researcher hopes to prove is \textbf{wrong}.

Alternative hypothesis (\(H_A\)): the new perspective; a difference/increase/decrease; an effect; not random chance; what the researcher hopes to prove is \textbf{correct}.

Null value: the value of the parameter when we assume the null hypothesis is true (labeled as \(parameter_0\)).

Null distribution: the simulated or modeled distribution of statistics (sampling distribution) we would expect to occur if the null hypothesis is true.

P-value: probability of seeing the observed sample data, or something more extreme, assuming the null hypothesis is true.

\(\implies\) Lower the p-value the stronger the evidence AGAINST the null hypothesis and FOR the alternative hypothesis.

Decision: a determination of whether to `reject' or `fail to reject' a null hypothesis based on a p-value and a pre-set level of significance.

Significance level (\(\alpha\)): a threshold used to determine if a p-value provides enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis or not.

\rgi Common levels of \(\alpha\) include 0.01, 0.05, and 0.10.

Statistically significant: results are considered statistically significant if the p-value is below the significance level.

Confidence interval: a process to determine how large an effect is; a range of plausible values for the parameter. Also called `estimation.'

Margin of error: the value that is added to and subtracted from the sample statistic to create a confidence interval; half the width of a confidence interval.

Confidence level: how confident we are that the confidence interval will capture the parameter.

To test the null hypothesis, we could use simulation-based methods as we did in Activity 9a. In this activity, we will focus on theory-based methods. Like with a single proportion, the sampling distribution of a difference in sample proportions can be mathematically modeled using the normal distribution if certain conditions are met.

Conditions for the sampling distribution of \(\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2\) to follow an approximate normal distribution:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Independence}: The data are independent within and between the two groups. (\emph{Remember}: This also must be true to use simulation methods!)
\item
  \textbf{Success-failure condition}: The success-failure condition holds for each group. Under the null hypothesis, the proportions \(\pi_1\) and \(\pi_2\) are equal, so we check the success-failure condition with our best estimate of these values under \(H_0\), the pooled proportion from the two samples,
\end{itemize}

\[
\hat{p}_{pool} = \frac{\text{number of "successes"}}{\text{number of cases}} = \frac{\hat{p}_1 n_1+\hat{p}_2 n_2}{n_1+n_2}
\]
\newpage

We then check that all four of the following inequalities hold:

\[\hat{p}_{pool} \times n_1 \ge 10, \hspace{1cm} (1 - \hat{p}_{pool}) \times n_1 \geq 10,\]
\[\hat{p}_{pool} \times n_2 \ge 10, \hspace{1cm} (1 - \hat{p}_{pool}) \times n_2 \geq 10\]

  The standardized statistic when the response variable is categorical is a Z-score and is compared to the standard normal distribution to find the p-value. To find the standardized statistic, we take the value of the statistic minus the null value, divided by the null standard error of the statistic. The standardized statistic measures the number of standard errors the statistic is from the null value.
\item
  Relative risk evaluates the percent increase or percent decrease in the response variable attributed to the explanatory variable. To find the percent increase or percent decrease we calculate the following \(\text{percent change}=(RR - 1)x100\%\). If relative risk is less than 1 there is a percent decrease. If relative risk is greater than 1 there is a percent increase.

Conditions for the sampling distribution of \(\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2\) to follow an approximate normal distribution:

\item
  \textbf{Success-failure condition}: The success-failure condition holds for each group. Since we are not assuming a null hypothesis, we do not use the pooled sample proportion to check this condition as we did in Activity 8. Instead, we use the individual sample proportions \(\hat{p}_1\) and \(\hat{p}_2\). Equivalently, we check that all cells in the table have at least 10 observations.

For this activity we will again use the Helmet Use and Head Injury data set. In Activity 10a we saw that there was evidence that helmet use is assoicated with a reduced risk of head injury. Today we will estimate the difference in proportion of head injuries for those who wore helmets and those who did not.

In ``Helmet Use and Risk of Head Injuries in Alpine Skiers and Snowboarders'' by Sullheim et. al., in the \emph{Journal of the American Medical Association}, Vol. 295, No.~8 (2006), we can see the summary results from a random sample of 3562 skiers and snowboarders involved in accidents in the two-way table below.

To find a confidence interval for the difference in proportions we will add and subtract the margin of error from the point estimate to find the two endpoints.

\[\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2\pm z^*SE(\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2), \hspace{.2cm} \text{where}\]
\[SE(\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2) = \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}_1 (1-\hat{p}_1)}{n_1}+\frac{\hat{p}_2 (1-\hat{p}_2)}{n_2}}\]

Note that the formula changes when calculating the variability around the statistic in order to calculate a confidence interval from the formula used in Activity 10a!

Recall that the \(z^*\) multiplier is the percentile of a standard normal distribution that corresponds to our confidence level. If our confidence level is 90\%, we find the Z values that encompass the middle 90\% of the standard normal distribution. If 90\% of the standard normal distribution should be in the middle, that leaves 10\% in the tails, or 5\% in each tail. The \texttt{qnorm()} function in \texttt{R} will tell us the \(z^*\) value for the desired percentile (in this case, 90\% + 5\% = 95\% percentile).

\item
  Simulation-based methods and theory-based methods should give the same results for a study \emph{if the validity conditions are met}. For both methods, observational units need to be independent. To use theory-based methods, additionally, the success-failure condition must be met. Check the validity conditions for each type of test to determine if theory-based methods can be used.
\item
  When calculating the standard error for the difference in sample proportions when doing a hypothesis test, we use the pooled proportion of successes, the best estimate for calculating the variability \emph{under the assumption the null hypothesis is true}. For a confidence interval, we are not assuming a null hypothesis, so we use the values of the two conditional proportions to calculate the standard error. Make note of the difference in these two formulas.
\item
  Increasing sample size will result in less sample-to-sample variability in statistics, which will result in a smaller standard error, and thus a narrower confidence interval.

Researchers compared the efficacy of two treatment regimens to achieve durable glycemic control in children and adolescents with recent-onset type 2 diabetes. A convenience sample of patients 10 to 17 years of age with recent-onset type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned to either a medication (rosiglitazone) or a lifestyle-intervention program focusing on weight loss through eating and activity. Researchers measured whether the patient still needs insulin (failure) or had glycemic control (success). Of the 233 children who received the Rosiglitazone treatment,143 had glycemic control, while of the 234 who went through the lifestyle-intervention program, 125 had glycemic control. Is there evidence that there is difference in proportion of patients that achieve durable glycemic control between the two treatments? Use Rosiglitazone -- Lifestyle as the order of subtraction.

To find a confidence interval for the difference in proportions we will add and subtract the margin of error from the point estimate to find the two endpoints.

\[\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2\pm z^*SE(\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2), \hspace{.2cm} \text{where}\]
\[SE(\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2) = \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}_1 (1-\hat{p}_1)}{n_1}+\frac{\hat{p}_2 (1-\hat{p}_2)}{n_2}}\]

Note that the formula changes when calculating the variability around the statistic in order to calculate a confidence interval from the formula used in Activity 19!

The \(z^*\) multiplier is the percentile of a standard normal distribution that corresponds to our confidence level. If our confidence level is 90\%, we find the Z values that encompass the middle 90\% of the standard normal distribution.

General steps of a hypothesis test:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Frame the research question in terms of hypotheses.
\item
  Collect and summarize data using a test statistic.
\item
  Assume the null hypothesis is true, and simulate or mathematically model a null distribution for the test statistic.
\item
  Compare the observed test statistic to the null distribution to calculate a p-value.
\item
  Make a conclusion based on the p-value and write the conclusion in context.
\end{enumerate}

Parameter: a value summarizing a variable(s) for a population.

Statistic: a value summarizing a variable(s) for a sample.

Sampling distribution: plot of statistics from 1000s of samples of the same size taken from the same population.

Standard deviation of a statistic: the variability of statistics from 1000s of samples; how far, on average, each statistic is from the true value of the parameter.

Standard error of a statistic: estimated standard deviation of a statistic.

Hypothesis test: a process to determine how strong the evidence of an effect is. Also called a `significance test.'

Simulation-based method: Simulate lots of samples of size \(n\) under assumption of the null hypothesis, then find the proportion of the simulations that are at least as extreme as the observed sample statistic.

Theory-based method: Develop a mathematical model for the sampling distribution of the statistic under the null hypothesis and use the model to calculate the probability of the observed sample statistic (or one more extreme) occurring.

Null hypothesis (\(H_0\)): the skeptical perspective; no difference; no change; no effect; random chance; what the researcher hopes to prove is \textbf{wrong}.

Alternative hypothesis (\(H_A\)): the new perspective; a difference/increase/decrease; an effect; not random chance; what the researcher hopes to prove is \textbf{correct}.

Null value: the value of the parameter when we assume the null hypothesis is true (labeled as \(parameter_0\)).

Null distribution: the simulated or modeled distribution of statistics (sampling distribution) we would expect to occur if the null hypothesis is true.

P-value: probability of seeing the observed sample data, or something more extreme, assuming the null hypothesis is true.

\(\implies\) Lower the p-value the stronger the evidence AGAINST the null hypothesis and FOR the alternative hypothesis.

Decision: a determination of whether to reject or fail to reject a null hypothesis based on a p-value and a pre-set level of significance.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  If p-value \(\leq \alpha\), then reject \(H_0\).
\item
  If p-value \(> \alpha\), then fail to reject \(H_0\).
\end{itemize}

Significance level (\(\alpha\)): a threshold used to determine if a p-value provides enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis or not.

\rgi Common levels of \(\alpha\) include 0.01, 0.05, and 0.10.

Statistically significant: results are considered statistically significant if the p-value is below the significance level.

Confidence interval: a process to determine how large an effect is; a range of plausible values for the parameter. Also called `estimation.'

Margin of error: the value that is added to and subtracted from the sample statistic to create a confidence interval; half the width of a confidence interval.

Bootstrapping: the process of drawing with replacement \(n\) times from the original sample.

Bootstrapped resample: a random sample of size \(n\) from the original sample, selected with replacement.

Bootstrapped statistic: the statistic recorded from the bootstrapped resample.

Confidence level: how confident we are that the confidence interval will capture the parameter.

Bootstrap \(X\)\% confidence interval: (\((\frac{(1-X)}{2})^{th}\) percentile, \((X+(\frac{(1-X)}{2})^{th}\) percentile) of a bootstrap distribution.

Central Limit Theorem: For large sample sizes, the sampling distribution of a sample mean (or proportion) will be approximately normal (bell-shaped and symmetric).

  Hoping to see how exercise is related to heart rates, researchers asked a group of 30 volunteers to do either bicycle kicks or jumping jacks for 30 seconds. Volunteer's heart rate was measured at the end of 30 seconds, then the volunteers sat for a 5 minute rest period. At the end of the rest period, the volunteer performed the other activity and their heart rate was measured again. Which activity was done first was randomly assigned.

All 8th graders were given the same lessons and same homework, then asked to take the same end-of-unit test.

\subsection{COVID-19 and air pollution}\label{covid-19-and-air-pollution}}

In June 2020, the social distancing efforts and stay-at-home directives to help combat the spread of COVID-19 appeared to help `flatten the curve' across the United States, albeit at a high cost to many individuals and businesses. The impact of these measures, though, goes far beyond the infection and death rates from the disease. You may have seen images comparing air quality in large international cities like Rome, Milan, Wuhan, and New Delhi such as the one pictured in Figure \ref{fig:covid}, which seem to indicate, perhaps unsurprisingly, that fewer people driving and factories being shut down have reduced air pollutants.

Have high population-density US cities seen the same improved air quality conditions? To study this question, data were gathered from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) AirData website which records the ozone (O3) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) values for cities across the US. These measures are used to calculate an air quality index (AQI) score for each city each day of the year. Thirty-three of the most densely populated US cities were selected and the AQI score recorded for April 20, 2020 as well as the five-year median AQI score for April 20th (2015--2019). Note that higher AQI scores indicate worse air quality. A box plot of the differences in AQI scores for the 33 cities and a table of summary statistics are shown on the next page.

To simulate the null distribution of paired sample mean differences we will use a bootstrapping method. Recall that the null distribution must be created under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true. Therefore, before bootstrapping, we will need to \emph{shift} each data point by the difference \(\mu_0 - \bar{x}_d\). This will ensure that the mean of the shifted data is \(\mu_0\) (rather than the mean of the original data, \(\bar{x}_d\)), and that the simulated null distribution will be centered at the null value.

  The differences in a paired data set are treated like a single quantitative variable when performing a statistical analysis. Paired data (or paired samples) occur when pairs of measurements are collected. We are only interested in the population (and sample) of differences, and not in the original data.
\item
  When using bootstrapping to create a null distribution centered at the null value for both paired data and a single quantitative variable, we first need to shift the data by the difference \(\mu_0 - \bar{x}_d\), and then sample with replacement from the shifted data.
\item
  When analyzing paired data, the summary statistic is the `mean difference' NOT the `difference in means'\footnote{Technically, if we calculate the differences and then take the mean (mean difference), and we calculate the two means and then take the difference (difference in means), the value will be the same. However, the \emph{sampling variability} of the two statistics will differ, as we will see in Activity 11.}. This terminology will be \emph{very} important in interpretations.
\item
  To create one simulated sample on the null distribution for a sample mean or mean difference, shift the original data by adding \((\mu_0 - \bar{x})\) or \((0 - \bar{x}_d)\). Sample with replacement from the shifted data \(n\) times. Calculate and plot the sample mean or the sample mean difference.
\item
  To create one simulated sample on the bootstrap distribution for a sample mean or mean difference, label \(n\) cards with the original response values. Randomly draw with replacement \(n\) times. Calculate and plot the resampled mean or the resampled mean difference.

The remaining questions cover theory-based methods for testing and estimating a paired mean difference (or single mean). Use Section 6.2.3 in the textbook and the OneMeanTheory video to complete the following questions.

The sampling distribution for \(\bar{x}\) based on a sample of size \(n\) from a population with a true mean \(\mu\) and true standard deviation \(\sigma\) can be modeled using a normal distribution when certain conditions are met.

Conditions for the sampling distribution of \(\bar{x}\) to follow an approximate normal distribution:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Independence}: The sample's observations are independent
\item
  \textbf{Normality}: The data should be approximately normal or the sample size should be large.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \(n < 30\): If the sample size \(n\) is less than 30 and there are no clear outliers in the data, then we typically assume the data come from a nearly normal distribution to satisfy the condition.
  \item
    \(n \geq 30\): If the sample size \(n\) is at least 30 and there are no particularly extreme outliers, then we typically assume the sampling distribution of \(\bar{x}\) is nearly normal, even if the underlying distribution of individual observations is not.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}

\item
  In the in-class activity, we verified that the independence condition was satisfied. Is the normality condition met to use the theory-based methods for analysis? Explain your answer.

To find the standardized statistic for the paired differences we will use the following formula:

\[T = \frac{\bar{x}_d}{SE(\bar{x}_d)},\]

To calculate the 99\% theory-based confidence interval for the paired mean difference, use the following formula:

\[\bar{x}_d\pm t^* SE(\bar{x}_d).\]

We will need to find the \(t^*\) multiplier using the function \texttt{qt()}. For a 99\% confidence level, we are finding the \(t^*\) value at the 99.5th percentile with \texttt{df} = \(n_d - 1 = 33 - 1 = 32\).

\(n_1\)= sample size of group 1

\(n_2\) = sample size of group 2

\(\overline{x}\) = sample mean

\(s\) = sample standard deviation

\(\mu\) = population mean

\(\sigma\) = population standard deviation

General steps of a hypothesis test:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Frame the research question in terms of hypotheses.
\item
  Collect and summarize data using a test statistic.
\item
  Assume the null hypothesis is true, and simulate or mathematically model a null distribution for the test statistic.
\item
  Compare the observed test statistic to the null distribution to calculate a p-value.
\item
  Make a conclusion based on the p-value and write the conclusion in context.
\end{enumerate}

Parameter: a value summarizing a variable(s) for a population.

Statistic: a value summarizing a variable(s) for a sample.

Sampling distribution: plot of statistics from 1000s of samples of the same size taken from the same population.

Standard deviation of a statistic: the variability of statistics from 1000s of samples; how far, on average, each statistic is from the true value of the parameter.

Standard error of a statistic: estimated standard deviation of a statistic.

Hypothesis test: a process to determine how strong the evidence of an effect is. Also called a `significance test.'

Simulation-based method: Simulate lots of samples of size \(n\) under assumption of the null hypothesis, then find the proportion of the simulations that are at least as extreme as the observed sample statistic.

Theory-based method: Develop a mathematical model for the sampling distribution of the statistic under the null hypothesis and use the model to calculate the probability of the observed sample statistic (or one more extreme) occurring.

Null hypothesis (\(H_0\)): the skeptical perspective; no difference; no change; no effect; random chance; what the researcher hopes to prove is \textbf{wrong}.

Alternative hypothesis (\(H_A\)): the new perspective; a difference/increase/decrease; an effect; not random chance; what the researcher hopes to prove is \textbf{correct}.

Null value: the value of the parameter when we assume the null hypothesis is true (labeled as \(parameter_0\)).

Null distribution: the simulated or modeled distribution of statistics (sampling distribution) we would expect to occur if the null hypothesis is true.

P-value: probability of seeing the observed sample data, or something more extreme, assuming the null hypothesis is true.

\(\implies\) Lower the p-value the stronger the evidence AGAINST the null hypothesis and FOR the alternative hypothesis.

Decision: a determination of whether to reject or fail to reject a null hypothesis based on a p-value and a pre-set level of significance.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  If p-value \(\leq \alpha\), then reject \(H_0\).
\item
  If p-value \(> \alpha\), then fail to reject \(H_0\).
\end{itemize}

Significance level (\(\alpha\)): a threshold used to determine if a p-value provides enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis or not.

\rgi Common levels of \(\alpha\) include 0.01, 0.05, and 0.10.

Statistically significant: results are considered statistically significant if the p-value is below the significance level.

Confidence interval: a process to determine how large an effect is; a range of plausible values for the parameter. Also called `estimation.'

Margin of error: the value that is added to and subtracted from the sample statistic to create a confidence interval; half the width of a confidence interval.

Bootstrapping: the process of drawing with replacement \(n\) times from the original sample.

Bootstrapped resample: a random sample of size \(n\) from the original sample, selected with replacement.

Bootstrapped statistic: the statistic recorded from the bootstrapped resample.

Confidence level: how confident we are that the confidence interval will capture the parameter.

Bootstrap \(X\)\% confidence interval: (\((\frac{(1-X)}{2})^{th}\) percentile, \((X+(\frac{(1-X)}{2})^{th}\) percentile) of a bootstrap distribution.

Central Limit Theorem: For large sample sizes, the sampling distribution of a sample mean (or proportion) will be approximately normal (bell-shaped and symmetric).

\(t\)-distribution: A bell-shaped symmetric distribution, centered at 0, wider than the standard normal distribution.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The variability in a \(t\)-distribution depends on the sample size (used to calculate degrees of freedom --- df for short).
\item
  The \(t\)-distribution gets closer to the standard normal distribution as df increases.
\end{itemize}

Degrees of freedom (df): describes the variability of the \(t\)-distribution.

T-score: the name for a standardized statistic which is compared to a \(t\)-distribution.

\subsection{Weather patterns and record snowfall}\label{weather-patterns-and-record-snowfall}}

In the winter of 2018--2019, Bozeman had a record snowfall which resulted in the collapse of two flat-roofed buildings on the MSU campus. A writer for the \emph{Washington Post} predicted the heavy snowfall for 2018--2019 due to the El Ni\latexcode{\~{n}}o weather pattern that occurred in that season. A meteorologist in Montana wanted to see if the weather pattern really was associated with total snowfall. She obtained historical data from 44 years on the weather pattern (El Ni\latexcode{\~{n}}o or La Ni\latexcode{\~{n}}a) and snowfall (in inches) at the Billings Weather Station. Side-by-side boxplots and summary statistics for each group are shown on the following page.

\subsection{Homeless Housing Stability}\label{homeless-housing-stability}}

Homeless people with substance abuse disorders (SUD) have high disease risk, poor access to health care, and are frequent users of Medicaid and other social services. Low-demand supportive housing with no prerequisites for treatment or sobriety has been shown to improve housing stability and decrease public service use for chronically homeless people with serious mental illness. Researchers in New York investigated if low-demand housing would also prove beneficial to chronic homeless people with SUD who do not suffer from serious mental illness or if pre-housing SUD treatments were required to improve outcomes. Between 2007 and 2012, 1937 chronic homeless people with SUD and without serious mental illness applying for low-demand housing were recruited to participate in the study. Researchers randomly assigned 1425 participants to receive SUD treatment prior to obtaining housing, the other 512 did not undergo SUD treatment. One of several outcomes measured was the length of stay in supportive housing used as a measure of housing stability. The length of stay for treatment groups is summarized in the \texttt{R} output provided. Is there evidence that SUD treatment affects the length of stay in supportive housing?

The sampling distribution for \(\bar{x}_1-\bar{x}_2\) can be modeled using a normal distribution when certain conditions are met.

Conditions for the sampling distribution of \(\bar{x}_1-\bar{x}_2\) to follow an approximate normal distribution:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Independence}: The sample's observations are independent
\item
  \textbf{Normality}: Each sample should be approximately normal or have a large sample size. For \emph{each} sample:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \(n < 30\): If the sample size \(n\) is less than 30 and there are no clear outliers in the data, then we typically assume the data come from a nearly normal distribution to satisfy the condition.
  \item
    \(n \ge 30\): If the sample size \(n\) is at least 30 and there are no particularly extreme outliers, then we typically assume the sampling distribution of \(\bar{x}\) is nearly normal, even if the underlying distribution of individual observations is not.

The Triple Crown of ``Thru'' hiking consists of hiking the Appalachian Trail, the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT), and the Continental Divide Trail (CDT). Each year halfwayanywhere.com conducts a survey to better understand the people who hike these trails. One variable which is queried in the survey is the pre-hike ``base weight'' of a hiker's pack which is the total weight of gear without food, water, and worn gear. The 131 hikers surveyed who completed the CDT had a mean base weight of 15.266 lbs (sd = 5.128 lbs). The 484 hikers surveyed who completed the PCT had a mean base weight of 17.837 lbs (sd = 7.823 lbs). Is there a difference in average base weight for PCT hikers and CDT hikers? Use order of subtraction CDT - PCT.

This means that the base weight observed in the data set would have been the same regardless of the type of trails.

Least squares regression line: \(\hat{y} = b_0+b_1x\) , where \(b_0\) is the sample \(y\)-intercept (the estimate for the \texttt{(Intercept)} row in the \texttt{R} regression output), and \(b_1\) is the sample slope (the estimate for the \texttt{x-variable\_name} row in the \texttt{R}).

Sample slope interpretation: a 1 unit increase in the \emph{x} variable is associated with a \(|b_1 |\) unit \emph{predicted} increase/decrease in the \emph{y}-variable.

General steps of a hypothesis test:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Frame the research question in terms of hypotheses.
\item
  Collect and summarize data using a test statistic.
\item
  Assume the null hypothesis is true, and simulate or mathematically model a null distribution for the test statistic.
\item
  Compare the observed test statistic to the null distribution to calculate a p-value.
\item
  Make a conclusion based on the p-value and write the conclusion in context.
\end{enumerate}

Parameter: a value summarizing a variable(s) for a population.

Statistic: a value summarizing a variable(s) for a sample.

Sampling distribution: plot of statistics from 1000s of samples of the same size taken from the same population.

Standard deviation of a statistic: the variability of statistics from 1000s of samples; how far, on average, each statistic is from the true value of the parameter.

Standard error of a statistic: estimated standard deviation of a statistic.

Hypothesis test: a process to determine how strong the evidence of an effect is. Also called a `significance test.'

Simulation-based method: Simulate lots of samples of size \(n\) under assumption of the null hypothesis, then find the proportion of the simulations that are at least as extreme as the observed sample statistic.

Theory-based method: Develop a mathematical model for the sampling distribution of the statistic under the null hypothesis and use the model to calculate the probability of the observed sample statistic (or one more extreme) occurring.

Null hypothesis (\(H_0\)): the skeptical perspective; no difference; no change; no effect; random chance; what the researcher hopes to prove is \textbf{wrong}.

Alternative hypothesis (\(H_A\)): the new perspective; a difference/increase/decrease; an effect; not random chance; what the researcher hopes to prove is \textbf{correct}.

Null value: the value of the parameter when we assume the null hypothesis is true (labeled as \(parameter_0\)).

Null distribution: the simulated or modeled distribution of statistics (sampling distribution) we would expect to occur if the null hypothesis is true.

P-value: probability of seeing the observed sample data, or something more extreme, assuming the null hypothesis is true.

\(\implies\) Lower the p-value the stronger the evidence AGAINST the null hypothesis and FOR the alternative hypothesis.

Decision: a determination of whether to reject or fail to reject a null hypothesis based on a p-value and a pre-set level of significance.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  If p-value \(\leq \alpha\), then reject \(H_0\).
\item
  If p-value \(> \alpha\), then fail to reject \(H_0\).
\end{itemize}

Significance level (\(\alpha\)): a threshold used to determine if a p-value provides enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis or not.

\rgi Common levels of \(\alpha\) include 0.01, 0.05, and 0.10.

Statistically significant: results are considered statistically significant if the p-value is below the significance level.

Confidence interval: a process to determine how large an effect is; a range of plausible values for the parameter. Also called `estimation.'

Margin of error: the value that is added to and subtracted from the sample statistic to create a confidence interval; half the width of a confidence interval.

Bootstrapping: the process of drawing with replacement \(n\) times from the original sample.

Bootstrapped resample: a random sample of size \(n\) from the original sample, selected with replacement.

Bootstrapped statistic: the statistic recorded from the bootstrapped resample.

Confidence level: how confident we are that the confidence interval will capture the parameter.

Bootstrap \(X\)\% confidence interval: (\((\frac{(1-X)}{2})^{th}\) percentile, \((X+(\frac{(1-X)}{2})^{th}\) percentile) of a bootstrap distribution

\(t\)-distribution: A bell-shaped symmetric distribution, centered at 0, wider than the standard normal distribution.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The variability in a \(t\)-distribution depends on the sample size (used to calculate degrees of freedom --- df for short).
\item
  The \(t\)-distribution gets closer to the standard normal distribution as df increases.
\end{itemize}

Degrees of freedom (df): describes the variability of the \(t\)-distribution.

T-score: the name for a standardized statistic which is compared to a \(t\)-distribution.

The government of Singapore took a random sample of 373 homes in Singapore to conduct a study on the relationship between the distance to the nearest train station (called MRT stations) and house prices. The house prices were measured in SGD (Singapore dollars) per meter squared and the distance was measured in meters. Does there appear to be a relationship between house prices in Singapore and distance to the nearest MRT station?

\subsection{Moneyball}\label{moneyball}}

The goal of a Major League baseball team is to make the playoffs. In 2002, the manager of the Oakland A's, Billy Bean, with the help of Paul DePodesta began to use statistics to determine which players to choose for their season. Based on past data, DePodesta determined that to make it to the playoffs, the A's would need to win at least 95 games in the regular season. In order to win more games, they would need to score more runs than they allowed. The Oakland A's won 20 consecutive games and a total of 103 games for the season. The success of this use of sports analytics was portrayed by the 2011 movie, \emph{Moneyball}.

In this study, we will see if there is evidence of a positive linear relationship between the difference in the number of runs scored minus the number of runs allowed and the number of wins for Major League baseball teams in the years before 2002.

Some of the variables collected in the data set \texttt{baseball} consist of the following:

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}ll@{}}

When performing inference on a least squares line, the follow conditions are generally required:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Independent observations} (for both simulation-based and theory-based methods): individual data points must be independent.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Check this assumption by investigating the sampling method and determining if the observational units are related in any way.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Linearity} (for both simulation-based and theory-based methods): the data should follow a linear trend.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Check this assumption by examining the scatterplot of the two variables, and a scatterplot of the residuals (on the \(y\)-axis) versus the fitted values (on the \(x\)-axis). The pattern in the residual plot should display a horizontal line.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Constant variability} (for theory-based methods only): the variability of points around the least squares line remains roughly constant

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Check this assumption by examining a scatterplot of the residuals (on the \(y\)-axis) versus the fitted values (on the \(x\)-axis). The variability in the residuals around zero should be approximately the same for all fitted values.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Nearly normal residuals} (for theory-based methods only: residuals must be nearly normal.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Check this assumption by examining a histogram of the residuals, which should appear approximately normal\footnote{A better plot for checking the normality assumption is called a \emph{normal quantile-quantile plot} (or QQ-plot). However, this type of plot will be covered in a future course}.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The scatterplot generated in question 2 and the residual plots shown below will be used to assess these conditions for approximating the data with the \(t\)-distribution.

Recall that a confidence interval is calculated by adding and subtracting the margin of error to the point estimate.\\
\[\mbox{point estimate}\pm t^*SE(\mbox{estimate}).\]
When the point estimate is a regression slope, this formula becomes
\[b_1 \pm t^* SE(b_1).\]

The \(t^*\) multiplier comes from a \(t\)-distribution with \(n-2\) degrees of freedom. Recall for a 95\% confidence interval, we use the 97.5\% percentile (95\% of the distribution is in the middle, leaving 2.5\% in each tail). The sample size for this study is 902 so we will use the degrees of freedom 900 (\(n-2\)).

\subsection{Black Bear Complaints}\label{black-bear-complaints}}

Black bears are notorious for human-wildlife conflicts. It is thought that hunting helps limit these interactions by acting as population control but there are other factors that play a role. In order to completely understand the relationship between population size and human-bear conflicts, a study in Minnesota looked at close to four decades of data. For each of 36 years, researchers recorded information about the number of complaints, food abundance rating, the number of bears removed from the population the previous year through hunter harvest or killing in conflict situations, estimated bear population size, whether the estimated population is over or under 15,000 bears, and whether a new or old policy regarding how complaints were dealt with was in effect (the new policy involved reducing site visits and eliminating translocations of bears in an effort to shift the responsibility for conflict resolution from the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources to homeowners and landowners). A goal of this study was to explore the effects of the previous variables on the number of complaints to provide improved guidance for managing harvests and conflicts in the future across the range of this species. Is there evidence that a higher food abundance rating is associated with a lower number of complaints?

Some of the variables collected in the data set \texttt{Bear\_Data} consist of the following:

Abstract

There has been an increased focus on the neurological consequences of repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (TBI), particularly neurodegenerative syndromes, such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE); however, no animal model exists that captures the behavioral spectrum of this phenomenon. We sought to develop an animal model of CTE. Our novel model is a modification and fusion of two of the most popular models of TBI and allows for controlled closed-head impacts to unanesthetized mice. Two-hundred and eighty 12-week-old mice were divided into control, single mild TBI (mTBI), and repetitive mTBI groups. Repetitive mTBI mice received six concussive impacts daily for 7 days. Behavior was assessed at various time points. Neurological Severity Score (NSS) was computed and vestibulomotor function tested with the wire grip test (WGT). Cognitive function was assessed with the Morris water maze (MWM), anxiety/risk-taking behavior with the elevated plus maze, and depression-like behavior with the forced swim/tail suspension tests. Sleep electroencephalogram/electromyography studies were performed at 1 month. NSS was elevated, compared to controls, in both TBI groups and improved over time. Repetitive mTBI mice demonstrated transient vestibulomotor deficits on WGT. Repetitive mTBI mice also demonstrated deficits in MWM testing. Both mTBI groups demonstrated increased anxiety at 2 weeks, but repetitive mTBI mice developed increased risk-taking behaviors at 1 month that persist at 6 months. Repetitive mTBI mice exhibit depression-like behavior at 1 month. Both groups demonstrate sleep disturbances. We describe the neurological consequenses of repetitive mTBI in a novel mouse model, which resemble several of the neuropsychiatric behaviors observed clinically in patients sustaining repetitive mild head injury.

Abstract
INTRODUCTION:

The goal was to identify which neurochemicals differ in professional athletes with repetitive brain trauma (RBT) when compared to healthy controls using a relatively new technology, in vivo Localized COrrelated SpectroscopY (L-COSY).

METHODS:

To achieve this, L-COSY was used to examine five former professional male athletes with 11 to 28 years of exposure to contact sports. Each athlete who had had multiple symptomatic concussions and repetitive sub concussive trauma during their career was assessed by an experienced neuropsychologist. All athletes had clinical symptoms including headaches, memory loss, confusion, impaired judgment, impulse control problems, aggression, and depression. Five healthy men, age and weight matched to the athlete cohort and with no history of brain trauma, were recruited as controls. Data were collected from the posterior cingulate gyrus using a 3 T clinical magnetic resonance scanner equipped with a 32 channel head coil.

RESULTS:

The variation of the method was calculated by repeated examination of a healthy control and phantom and found to be 10\% and 5\%, respectively, or less. The L-COSY measured large and statistically significant differences (P \textless=0.05), between healthy controls and those athletes with RBT. Men with RBT showed higher levels of glutamine/glutamate (31\%), choline (65\%), fucosylated molecules (60\%) and phenylalanine (46\%). The results were evaluated and the sample size of five found to achieve a significance level P=0.05. Differences in N-acetyl aspartate and myoinositol between RBT and controls were small and were not statistically significance.

CONCLUSIONS:

A study of a small cohort of professional athletes, with a history of RBT and symptoms of chronic traumatic encephalopathy when compared with healthy controls using 2D L-COSY, showed elevations in brain glutamate/glutamine and choline as recorded previously for early traumatic brain injury. For the first time increases in phenylalanine and fucose are recorded in the brains of athletes with RBT. Larger studies utilizing the L-COSY method may over an in-life method of diagnosis and personalized approach for monitoring the acute effects of mild traumatic brain injury and the chronic effects of RBT.

  Here's a quote from a news report in 2013:
  ``We need to figure out what's making some people more vulnerable than others,'' says Michelle Mielke, an Alzheimer's researcher at the Mayo Clinic who led the study. It was published online Thursday in the journal Neurology. Just because you have a head trauma doesn't mean you're going to develop memory problems or significant amyloid levels," Mielke told Shots. And it doesn't
  mean you're going to get Alzheimer's. ``But it does suggest to us that there's a mechanism with head trauma that does increase your risk.''
\end{enumerate}

Mielke and her colleagues did PET scans on 589 people who are participating in a long-term study of aging and memory. That's a lot of people for a brain imaging study, which makes it more likely that the findings are accurate.

Some have argued that blows to the head - for instance on the high school football field - are getting too much attention. They point out that of many kids taking similar hits, only a few show lasting decrease in cognitive abilities, and suggest that the effects are as much due to genetics as to the blow to the head.

  Who will your subjects be? How will you find them? How many will you need?
\item
  What will you measure? (Brain scans like MRI? Cognitive tests of memory and reasoning? Some measure of emotional states like anger?) Include the timing of measurements.

  In reading a research article, carefully read what they say about selection of subjects (or units of study) so we know how far we can extend our inference.
\item
  Similarly, evaluate the assignment of any treatments (at random, we hope) so that we know if causal inference is appropriate.
\item
  In designing a study, we'd like to get a large sample, but expense might prevent that.
\item
  You might see names of tests we've not covered, but the idea of a p-value is the same for any test, and the null hypothesis is generally ``No change,'' or ``No effect.''
