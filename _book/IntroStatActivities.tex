\section{Activity}\label{activity}}

How well can humans distinguish one ``Martian'' letter from another? In today's activity, we'll find out. When shown the two Martian letters, Kiki and Bumba, write down whether you think Bumba is on the left or the right.

\vspace{0.5in}

\hypertarget{steps-of-statistical-investigation}{%
\subsection{Steps of Statistical Investigation}\label{steps-of-statistical-investigation}}

The first step of any statistical investigation is to ask a research question. In this study the research question is: can we as a class read Martian? (we will refine this later on!). To answer any research question, we must design a study and collect data. (This will normally be provided for you in class.) For our question, the study consists of each student being presented with two Martian letters and asking which was Bumba. Your responses will become our observed data that we will explore. To answer the research question we will simulate what \emph{could} have happened in our class given random chance, repeat that many times to understand the expected variability between different ``randomly guessing'' classes, then comparing our class's observed data to the simulation. This gives us an estimate of how often (or the probability of) our class's result would occur if we were all merely guessing, allowing us to determine if we as a class can in fact read Martian.

Let's explore the data.
\textbf{Observational units} or \textbf{cases} are the subjects data is collected on. In a data set the rows will represent a single observational unit.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  What are the observational units in this study?
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{0.5in}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  How many students are in class today? This is the sample size.
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{0.5in}

\newpage

A \textbf{variable} is information collected or measured on each observational unit or case. We will look at two types of variables: \textbf{quantitative} and \textbf{categorical}. Each column in a data set will represent a different variable.

Quantitative variables are numerical measurements that can be discrete (whole, non-negative numbers) or continuous (any value within an interval). The number of students in a class would be a discrete variable as you can not have a partial student. GPA would be a continuous variable ranging from 0 to 4.0.

Categorical variables are data that are in groups or categories such as eye color, state of residency, or whether or not a student is considered in-state. Categorical variables with a natural ordering are considered ordinal variables while those without a natural ordering are considered a nominal variable. All variables will be treated as nominal for analysis.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{images/variables}

\caption{Types of variables.}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-1}
\end{figure}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\tightlist
\item
  Identify the variable we are collecting on each observational unit in this study, i.e., what are we measuring on each student?
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{.8in}

It is important to note that a variable is different than a summary statistic. A variable is measured on a \textbf{single observational unit} while a summary statistic is calculated from a group of observational units. For example, the variable \textbf{whether or not a student is considered in-state} can be measured on each individual student. In a class of 50 students we can calculate the proportion of students who are considered in-state, the summary statistic. Make sure you wrote the variable in question 3 as a variable \textbf{NOT} a summary statistic.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{3}
\tightlist
\item
  Is the variable identified in question 3 categorical or quantitative?
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{0.3in}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{4}
\tightlist
\item
  Were you correct or incorrect in identifying Bumba?
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{0.3in}

We will now collect the data from the entire class.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{5}
\tightlist
\item
  How many people in your class were correct in identifying Bumba? Using the class size from question 2, calculate the proportion of students who correctly identified Bumba.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{center}
$\mbox{proportion} = \frac{\mbox{number of students who correctly identified Bumba}}{\mbox{total number of students}}$
\end{center}

\newpage

Looking at the data set and the summary statistics is only one way to display the data. We will also want to create a visualization or picture of the data. A \textbf{frequency bar plot} is used to display categorical data as a count or frequency. Since our variable has two levels, correct or incorrect, we will create two bars one for each level.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{6}
\tightlist
\item
  Plot the observed class data using a frequency bar plot.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{flushleft}\includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{images/barplot_martian} \end{flushleft}

We can also visualize the data as a proportion in a \textbf{relative frequency bar plot}. Relative frequency is the proportion calculated for each level of the categorical variable.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{7}
\tightlist
\item
  Plot the observed class data using a relative frequency bar plot.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{flushleft}\includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{images/relative_barplot_martian} \end{flushleft}

\newpage

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{8}
\item
  The next step is to analyze the data. If humans really don't know Martian and are just guessing which is Bumba, what are the chances of getting it right?
  \vspace{0.5in}

  How could we use a coin to simulate each student ``just guessing'' which martian letter is Bumba?
  \vspace{1in}

  How could we use coins to simulate the entire class ``just guessing'' which martian letter is Bumba?
  \vspace{1in}

  How many people in your class would you expect to choose Bumba correctly just by chance? Explain your reasoning.
  \vspace{1in}
\item
  Each of you will flip a coin one time to simulate your ``guess''. Let Heads = correct, Tails = incorrect. What was the result of your simulation?
  \vspace{.4in}

  What was the result from your class's simulation? What proportion of students ``guessed'' correctly in the simulation?
  \vspace{.4in}
\item
  If students really don't know Martian and are just guessing which is Bumba, which seems more unusual: the result from your class's \textbf{simulation} or the observed proportion of students in your class that were correct (this is your data from question 6)? Explain your reasoning.
\end{enumerate}

\newpage

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{11}
\tightlist
\item
  While your observed class data is likely far different from the simulated ``just-guessing'' class, comparing our class data to a single simulation does not seem to give enough information. The differences seen could just be due to that set of coin flips! Let's simulate another class. Each student should flip your coin again. What was the result from your class's second simulation? What proportion of students ``guessed'' correctly in the second simulation? Create a plot to compare the two simulated results with the observed class result.
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{1in}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{12}
\tightlist
\item
  We still unfortunately only have a couple of simulations to compare our class data to. It would be much better to be able to see how our class compared to hundreds or thousands of ``just-guessing'' classes. Since we don't want to flip coins all class period, your instructor will use a computer simulation to get 1000 trials. Fill in the following blanks to describe how we would create a simulation of random guessing with 1000 trials.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  In this course we will learn how to evaluate a claim by comparing observed results (classes' ``guesses'') to a distribution of many simulated results under an assumption like ``blind guessing.''
\item
  Blind guessing between two outcomes will be correct only about half the time. We can create data (via computer simulation) to fit the assumption of blind guessing.
\item
  Unusual observed results will make us doubt the assumptions used to create the simulated distribution. A large number of correct ``guesses'' is evidence that a person was not just blindly guessing.

The two main study designs we will cover are observational studies and experiments. Both the sampling method and the study design will help to determine the \textbf{scope of inference} for a study. Remember that only in a randomized experiment can we conclude a \textbf{causal} (cause and effect) relationship between the explanatory and response variable.

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{images/ScopeOfInference} \end{center}

For the next exercises, identify the explanatory variable, the response variable, a potential confounding variable, and the study design.

They will then be followed to assess vaccine related symptoms and development of COVID-19. The trial is blinded, so the investigators and the participants will not know who is assigned to which group.

The slope measures the change in y for each increase in x by 1. In other words, as the x variable increases by 1 unit, the y variable changes (increase/decreases) by the value of slope.

The linear model function in R gives us the summary for the least squares regression line. The estimate for (Intercept) is the y-intercept for the line of least squares and the estimate for budget is the value of \(b_1\), the slope.

\begin{verbatim}
#>               Estimate Std. Error  t value     Pr(>|t|)

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Ask a research question} that can be addressed by collecting data. What are the researchers trying to show.
\item
  \textbf{Design a study and collect data}. This step involves selecting the people or objects to be studied and how to gather relevant data on them.
\item
  \textbf{Summarize and Visualize the data}. Calculate summary statistics and create graphical plots that best represent the research question.
\item
  \textbf{Use statistical analysis methods to draw inferences from the data}. Choose an analysis technique appropriate for the data and identify the p-value. In this study, we will focus on using randomization.
\item
  \textbf{Communicate the results and answer the research question}. Using the p-value and confidence interval from the analysis, determine whether the data provide statistical evidence against the null hypothesis.
\item
  \textbf{Revisit and look forward} to point out limitations of the study and suggest new studies that could be performed to build on the findings of the study

Left-handedness is a trait that is found in about 10\% of the population. The fighting claim states that left-handed men have an advantage in competition. Past studies have shown that left-handed men are over-represented among professional fighters. In this random sample of 500 male boxers we will see if there is an over-prevalence of left-handed fighters.

When testing data we must first identify the null hypothesis. The null hypothesis is written about the parameter of interest, the true value of interest.

\end{enumerate}

\vspace{1in}

The notation used for a true proportion is \(\pi\). Since this summarizes a population, it is a parameter. When writing the null hypothesis in notation we set the parameter equal to the null value, \(H_0: \pi = \pi_0\)

\begin{enumerate}

\vspace{0.5in}

Remember that when utilizing a hypothesis test, we are evaluating two competing possibilities. For this study the \textbf{two possibilities} are either\ldots{}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The true proportion of male boxers who are left handed is 0.1 and our results just occurred by random chance or
\item
  The true proportion of male boxers who are left handed is greater than 0.1 and our results reflect this
\end{itemize}

Notice that these two competing possibilities represent the null and alternative hypotheses.

The null distribution is created under the assumption the null hypothesis is true. In this case, we assume the true proportion of male boxers who are left handed is 0.1 so we will create 1000 different simulations of 500 boxers under this assumption.

Let's think about how to use cards to create one simulation of 500 boxers under the assumption the null hypothesis is true. Suppose blue cards represents left-handed and red cards represents right-handed.

\begin{enumerate}

  Next, we would mix the cards together and draw 1 card, write down if it's red or blue, and replace the card. How many times would we need to repeat this process to simulate our sample?

We will use the computer to simulate 1000 simulated proportions of male boxers who are left handed for a sample size of 500 based on the assumption that the true proportion of male boxers who are left handed is 0.1. This is called the null distribution because it is created based on the assumption that the null hypothesis is true.

To use the computer simulation, we will need to enter the ``probability of success,'' ``sample size,'' ``number of repetitions,'' ``as extreme as,'' and the ``direction'' (matches the direction of the alternative hypothesis).

A point estimate provides a single plausible value for a parameter. However, a point estimate is rarely perfect; usually there is some error in the estimate. In addition to supplying a point estimate of a parameter, a next logical step would be to provide a plausible range of values for the parameter. This plausible range of values for the population parameter is called a confidence interval.

To test the null hypothesis we could use simulation methods as we did with a single categorical variable. In this activity we will focus on theory-based methods. Like with a single proportion, the difference in proportions can be mathematically modeled using the normal distribution if certain conditions are met.

Conditions for the sample distribution of \(\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2\)

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Independence: The data are independent within and between the two groups.
\item
  Success-Failure Condition: The success-failure condition holds for each group.

To calculate the test statistic we use:

\begin{center}
    $Z = \frac{\text{point estimate} - \text{null value}}{SE}$

where the standard error is calculated using the pooled proportion of successes.

   $SE(\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2)=\sqrt{\hat{p}_{pool}(1-\hat{p}_{pool})(\frac{1}{n_1}+\frac{1}{n_2})}, \text{where}$ 
    
   $\hat{p}_{pool} = \frac{\text{number of "successes"}}{\text{number of cases}} = \frac{\hat{p}_1 n_1+\hat{p}_2 n_2}{n_1+n_2}$

To find a confidence interval for the difference in proportions we will add and subtract the margin of error from the point estimate to find the two endpoints.

\[\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2\pm z^*SE(\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2), \text{where}\]

\[SE(\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2) = \sqrt{\left(\frac{\hat{p}_1 (1-\hat{p}_1)}{n_1}+\frac{\hat{p}_2 (1-\hat{p}_2)}{n_2}\right)}\]

Note that the formula changes when calculating the variability around the statistic in order to calculate a confidence interval! Here use the sample proportions for each group to calculate the standard error for the difference in proportions. The \(z^*\) multiplier is found under the normal distribution. We find the values that encompass the middle 95\% of the data.

\section{COVID-19 and Air Pollution}\label{covid-19-and-air-pollution}}

The social distancing efforts and stay-at-home directives to help combat the spread of COVID-19 have appeared to help `flatten the curve' across the United States, albeit at a high cost to many individuals and businesses. The impact of these measures, though, goes far beyond the infection and death rates from the disease. You may have seen images comparing air quality in large international cities like Rome, Milan, Wuhan, and New Delhi such as the one pictured below which seem to indicate, perhaps unsurprisingly, that fewer people driving and factories being shut down have reduced air pollutants.

\includegraphics{images/air_pollution.png}

Have high population-density U.S. cities seen the same improved air quality conditions? To study this question, data was gathered from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) AirData website which records the ozone (O3) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) values for cities across the U.S. These measures are used to calculate an air quality index (AQI) score for each city each day of the year. Thirty-three of the most densely populated U.S. cities were selected and the AQI score recorded for April 20, 2020 as well as the five-year median AQI score for April 20th (2015 - 2019). Note that higher AQI scores indicate worse air quality.

In the winter of 2018-2019, Bozeman had a record snowfall which resulted in the collapse of two flat-roofed buildings on the MSU campus. A writer for the Washington Post predicted the heavy snowfall for 2018-2019 due to the El Nino weather pattern that occurred in that season. A meteorologist in Montana wanted to see if the weather pattern really was associated with total snowfall. She obtained historical data from 44 years on the weather pattern (El Nino or La Nina) and snowfall (in inches) at the Billings Weather Station.

\section{Hand Dexterity}\label{hand-dexterity}}

Physical therapists often evaluate manual (hand) dexterity by having patients complete simple tasks, such as moving pegs on a board or threading objects through holes. Researchers want to examine the manual dexterity of children as part of a follow-up study of a test originally designed for adults to see how manual dexterity changes with age. In this test, 174 participants were given a board with 16 pegs, each in their own hole, arranged in a 4x4 grid. Participants were instructed to pick up the peg with one hand, flip it over by rotating their wrist, then reinsert it in the same hole. Using this test, researchers want to know if as people age the speed at which they can flip all 16 pegs increases.

The variables in this dataset consist of the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{time:} Recorded time to flip all 16 pegs, measured in seconds.
\item
  \textbf{speed:} The average speed to flip a peg for each participant (seconds per peg).
\item
  \textbf{age:} Age of the participants, measured in years.
\item
  \textbf{dominant:} Whether the participant's dominant hand was used, coded as 0 for no, 1 for yes.
\item
  \textbf{gender:} The participant's gender, recorded as a binary variable, 0 for male, 1 for female.
\item
  \textbf{HD:} The dominant hand of the participant, recorded as ``R'' for right hand, ``L'' for left hand.
\item
  \textbf{handUsed:} Which hand the participant used to complete the test, recorded as ``R'' for right hand, ``L'' for left hand.

Recall that a confidence interval is calculated by adding and subtracting the margin of error to the point estimate.

\(\mbox{point estimate}\pm t^*SE(estimate)\)
\(b_1 \pm t^* SE(b_1)\)

The \(t^*\) multiplier comes from the t-distribution with \(n-2\) df.
