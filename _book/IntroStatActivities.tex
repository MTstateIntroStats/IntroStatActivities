This coursepack accompanies the textbook for STAT 216: Introduction to Statistics at Montana State University. Each of the activities in this workbook is designed to target specific learning outcomes of the course, giving you practice with important statistical concepts in a group setting with instructor guidance. Bring this workbook with you to class each week, and take notes in the workbook as you would your own notes. A well-written complete workbook will provide an optimal study guide for exams!

\item
  Explain the purpose of random assignment and its effect on scope of inference
\item
  Identify whether a study is observational or an experiment
\item

In today's activity, we will examine different types of sampling bias and study designs, confounding variables, and how to determine the scope of inference for a study. Some terms covered in this activity are:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Population
\item
  Sample
\item
  Parameter
\item
  Statistic
\item
  Selection bias
\item
  Response bias
\item
  Non-response bias
\item
  Scope of inference
\item
  Explanatory variable
\item
  Response variable
\item
  Confounding variable
\item
  Experiment
\item
  Observational study
\end{itemize}

To review these concepts see Sections 1.3 through 1.6 in the textbook.

\hypertarget{types-of-sampling-bias}{%
\section{Types of sampling bias}\label{types-of-sampling-bias}}

There are two parts to study design: how the sample was selected and how the study was conducted. First we will look at sampling and types of bias.

In these next questions, identify the target population, the sample, the variable, and the type of bias present.

  To determine if the proportion of out of state undergraduate students at Montana State University has increased in the last 10 years, a statistics instructor sent an email survey to 500 randomly selected current undergraduate students. One of the questions on the survey asked whether they had in-state or out-of-state residency. She only received 378 responses.

  PEW Research surveys US adults about many different topics. Recently a survey was conducted to assess current presidential approval. A random sample of 6395 US adults was taken. Of those surveyed, 42\% say they agree with President Trump on many or nearly all of the top issues facing the country today.

  A television station is interested in predicting whether or not a local referendum to legalize marijuana for adult use will pass. It asks its viewers to phone in and indicate whether they are in favor of this or opposed to this. Of the 2241 viewers who phoned in, forty-five percent were opposed to legalizing marijuana.

\hypertarget{study-design-1}{%
\section{Study design}\label{study-design-1}}

The two main study designs we will cover are observational studies and experiments. Both the sampling method and the study design will help to determine the \textbf{scope of inference} for a study. Remember that only in a randomized experiment can we conclude a \textbf{causal} (cause and effect) relationship between the explanatory and response variable.

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{images/ScopeOfInference} \end{center}

For the next exercises, identify the explanatory variable, the response variable, a potential confounding variable, and the study design.

\item
  The pharmaceutical company, Moderna Therapeutics is working in conjunction with the National Institute of Health towards a vaccine for COVID-19 and has recently begun Phase 3 clinical trials. US Clinical research sites will enroll 30,000 volunteers without COVID-19 to participate. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either the candidate vaccine or a saline placebo. They will then be followed to assess vaccine related symptoms and development of COVID-19. The trial is blinded, so the investigators and the participants will not know who is assigned to which group.

\item
  In another study, a local health department randomly selected 1000 US adults without COVID-19 to participate in a health survey. Each participant was assessed at the beginning of the study and then followed for 1 year. They were interested to see which participants elected to receive a vaccination for COVID-19 and whether any participants developed COVID-19.
