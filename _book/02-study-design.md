##### Notes on types of sampling bias {-}

* Someone must first be _chosen_ to be in a study and refuse to participate in order to have **non-response bias**.

* There must be a valid reason for someone to lie or be untruthful to justify saying **response bias** is present.  Yes, anyone could lie at any time to any question.  Response bias is when those lies are predictable and systematic based on outside influences.
\rgs


True or False: Convenience sampling tends to result in non-response bias.

True or False: Volunteer sampling tends to result in response bias.

True or False: Random sampling helps to resolve selection bias, but has no impact on non-response or response bias.

**Explanatory variable**: The variable researchers think _may be_ effecting the other variable.  What the researchers control/assign in an experiment.  If comparing groups, the explanatory variable puts the observational units into groups.

**Response variable**: The variable researchers think _may be_ influenced by the other variable.  This variable is always observed, never controlled or assigned.

True or False: Observational studies can show an association between two variables, but cannot determine a causal relationship.
	
True or False: In order for an experiment to be valid, a placebo must be used.

True or False: If random sampling of the target population is used, and no other types of bias are suspected, results from the sample can be generalized to the entire target population.

True or False: If random sampling of the target population is used, and no other types of bias are suspected, results from the sample can be inferred as a causal relationship between the explanatory and response variables.

### Types of sampling bias: Complete Q1 before class.  

There are two parts to study design: how the sample was selected and how the study was conducted.  First, we will look at sampling and types of bias (selection, non-response, or response).

In these next questions, identify the target population, the sample selected, the variable, and the type of bias present.

1. To determine if the proportion of out-of-state undergraduate students at Montana State University has increased in the last 10 years, a statistics instructor sent an email survey to 500 randomly selected current undergraduate students.  One of the questions on the survey asked whether they had in-state or out-of-state residency.  She only received 378 responses.

2.  Pew Research surveys US adults about many different topics.  Recently, a survey was conducted to assess current presidential approval.  A random sample of 6395 US adults was taken.  One of the questions asked in the survey was, "Do you agree or disagree with President Trump on many or nearly all of the top issues facing the country today?" Of those surveyed, 42% said they did agree.

3. A television station is interested in predicting whether or not a local referendum to legalize marijuana for adult use will pass. It asks its viewers to phone in and indicate whether they are in favor or opposed to the referendum. Of the 2241 viewers who phoned in, forty-five percent were opposed to legalizing marijuana.

### Study design
The two main study designs we will cover are **observational studies** and **experiments**.  Both the sampling method and the study design will help to determine the **scope of inference** for a study.  Remember that only in a randomized experiment can we conclude a **causal** (cause and effect) relationship between the explanatory and response variable.


\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{images/ScopeOfInferenceGreyscale} \end{center}

For the next exercises, identify the explanatory variable, the response variable, the study design (observational study or experiment), and the scope of inference (using the above chart).

5. The pharmaceutical company Moderna Therapeutics is working in conjunction with the National Institutes of Health towards a vaccine for COVID-19 and has recently begun Phase 3 clinical trials.  US clinical research sites will enroll 30,000 volunteers without COVID-19 to participate. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either the candidate vaccine or a saline placebo.  They will then be followed to assess whether or not they develop COVID-19. The trial is double-blind, so neither the investigators nor the participants will know who is assigned to which group.

6. In another study, a local health department randomly selected 1000 US adults without COVID-19 to participate in a health survey.  Each participant was assessed at the beginning of the study and then followed for one year.  They were interested to see which participants elected to receive a vaccination for COVID-19 and whether any participants developed COVID-19.

A **confounding variable** is a variable that is _both_

1. associated with the explanatory variable, _and_
2. associated with the response variable.

When both these conditions are met, if we observe an association between the explanatory variable and the response variable in the data, we cannot be sure if this association is due to the explanatory variable or the confounding variable---the explanatory and confounding variables are "confounded."


\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.4\linewidth]{02-study-design_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-2-1} \end{center}

7. For each of the studies in questions 5 and 6, determine whether confounding variables could be an issue. If so, identify a potential confounding variable and explain how it meets the definition of a confounding variable.

### Out-of-class activity

In the in-class activity we looked at sampling methods and study design.  Here are a few more questions to review that material.  

1. The Bozeman school district is interested in surveying parents of students about their opinions on returning to in-person classes following the COVID-19 pandemic.  They divided the school district into 10 divisions based on location and randomly surveyed 20 households within each division.  Explain why selection bias would be present in this study design.
\vspace{1in}

2. A study published in 2007 by Christopher Johnson, professor of music education and music therapy at the University of Kansas, revealed that students in elementary schools with superior music education programs scored around 20 percent higher in math scores on standardized tests, compared to schools with low-quality music programs.  Explain how school budget could be a potential confounding variable.  Be sure to address how the confounding variable is related to both the explanatory and response variable. 

\vspace{1in}

3.  What is the purpose of random selection of a sample from the population? 

\vspace{0.8in}

4.  What is the purpose of random assignment of the cases in a study to the explanatory variable groups?

\vspace{0.8in}



### Take-home messages

1.	If the sample is selected using a non-biased method of selection (i.e. a random sample of the target population) then the results of the study can be generalized to the target population.  When using biased methods of selection the results only apply to the sample selected or similar observational units.

2.  The study design determines if we can draw causal inferences or not.  A randomized experiment allows us to conclude that there is a causal (cause and effect) relationship between the explanatory and response variable.  Observational studies have potential confounding variables within the study that prevent us from drawing a causal relationship between the variables.

3.  Confounding variables are variables not included in the study that are related to both the explanatory and the response variables. When there are potential confounding variables in the study we cannot draw a causal inferences.
