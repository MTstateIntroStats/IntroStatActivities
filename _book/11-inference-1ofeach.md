\setstretch{1}

### Learning objectives

* Write out the null and alternative hypothesis for one categorical and one quantitative variable

* Calculate and carry-out simulation based hypothesis test for a difference in means

* Interpret and evaluate a p-value

* Find a bootstrap confidence interval for a difference in means

* Interpret a confidence interval

* Use a confidence interval to determine the conclusion of a hypothesis test

### Terminology review

In this week's in-class activity, we will use simulation-based methods to analyze one categorical and one quantitative variable, where the groups formed by the categorical variable are independent. Some terms covered in this activity are:

* Independent groups

* Difference in means

To review these concepts, see Section 6.3 in the textbook.

### Weather patterns and record snowfall

In the winter of 2018-2019, Bozeman had a record snowfall which resulted in the collapse of two flat-roofed buildings on the MSU campus.  A writer for the Washington Post predicted the heavy snowfall for 2018-2019 due to the El Ni\latexcode{\~{n}}o weather pattern that occurred in that season. A meteorologist in Montana wanted to see if the weather pattern really was associated with total snowfall. She obtained historical data from 44 years on the weather pattern (El Ni\latexcode{\~{n}}o or La Ni\latexcode{\~{n}}a) and snowfall (in inches) at the Billings Weather Station.  

Notice from the `R` code that the name of the data set is `Snow`.


```r
Snow <- read.csv("data/SnowfallbyWeatherPattern.csv") # Read in data set
# Code categorical variables as factors
Snow <- # Write over original data with the following
  Snow %>% # Pipe data set into
  mutate(WeatherPattern = factor(WeatherPattern)) # Convert to factor
```

\newpage


```r
# Side-by-side box plots
Snow %>%
ggplot(aes(x = WeatherPattern, y = Snowfall)) +
    geom_boxplot() + 
    labs(title = "Snowfall by weather pattern",
         x = "Weather pattern") +
    coord_flip()
```



\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{11-inference-1ofeach_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-2-1} \end{center}


```r
# Summary statistics
Snow %>%

#### Quantitative variables review.  Complete Q1 - 5 before class. {-}

1. The two variables assessed in this study are the type of weather pattern and snowfall.  Identify the role for each variable (explanatory, response).

\vspace{.6in}

2. Which group (El Ni\latexcode{\~{n}}o or La Ni\latexcode{\~{n}}a) has the highest center? Explain which measure of center you are using.

\vspace{.6in}

3.  Using the side-by-side boxplots, which group has the largest spread?  How did you make that choice?

\vspace{.6in}

\newpage

4.  Is this an experiment or an observational study? Justify your answer.

\vspace{1in}

5.  Is this a paired data set or two independent groups?  Explain your reasoning.

\vspace{1in}

#### Ask a research question {-}

6.  Write out the parameter of interest in context of the study.  Use proper notation and be sure to define your subscripts.  Use El Ni\latexcode{\~{n}}o minus La Ni\latexcode{\~{n}}a as the order of subtraction.

\vspace{1in}

7.  What are the two competing possibilities we will evaluate in this study?

\vspace{1in}

8.  Identify which of your answers in question 7 is the null hypothesis and which is the alternative hypothesis. 

\vspace{1in}

#### Summarize and visualize the data {-}

9. Calculate the summary statistic.  Use El Ni\latexcode{\~{n}}o minus La Ni\latexcode{\~{n}}a as the order of subtraction. What is the appropriate notation for the statistic?

\vspace{0.5in}

\newpage 

#### Use statistical inferential methods to draw inferences from the data {-}

Remember that the null distribution is created based on the assumption the null hypothesis is true.  In this study, we assume there is no association between variables.  This means that a snowfall value could be in either an El Ni\latexcode{\~{n}}o year or a La Ni\latexcode{\~{n}}a year.

To demonstrate this your instructor will use cards to represent the sample.  

10.  How many cards will we start with?

\vspace{0.5in}

11.  What will we write on each card?

\vspace{0.5in}

12.  Next we will mix the cards together and shuffle into two piles.  How many cards will go into each pile?  What should we label the piles?

\vspace{1in}

13.  What value is calculated from the cards and plotted on the null distribution?  *Hint*: What statistic are we calculating from the data?

\vspace{0.3in}

14.  Once we create a null distribution of 1000 simulations, at what value do you expect the distribution to be centered?  Explain your reasoning.

\vspace{.8in}

**Simulation method**

15.  When using the two mean test we need to enter the name of the response variable, `Snowfall` and the name of the explanatory variable, `WeatherPattern` for the formula.  The name of the data set as shown above is `Snow`.  What values should be entered for each of the following into the two mean test to create 1000 simulations?

\vspace{.2in}
* First in Subtraction (What is the outcome for the explanatory variable that is used as first in the order of subtraction? `"El_Nino"` or `"La_Nina"`:

\vspace{.2in}
* Number of repetitions:
    
\vspace{.2in}
* As extreme as:
    
\vspace{.2in}
* Direction (`"greater"`, `"less"`, or `"two-sided"`):

\vspace{.2in}

16.  Using the `RScript` file for this activity, enter your answers for question 15 in place of the xx's to produce the null distribution with 1000 simulations.  Highlight and run lines 1 - 29.


```r
two_mean_test(Snowfall~WeatherPattern, data = Snow,  # Variables and data
                    first_in_subtraction = "xx", # First outcome in order of subtraction
                    number_repetitions = 1000,  # Number of simulations
                    as_extreme_as = xx,  # Observed statistic
                    direction = "xx")  # Direction of alternative: "greater", "less", or "two-sided"
```

Sketch the null distribution created using the code above.

17.  Report the p-value. How much evidence does the p-value provide against the null hypothesis?

\vspace{0.5in}

18. Using bootstrapping find a 95\% confidence interval. Use the provided `RScript` file for the two mean bootstrap CI function. Enter the variable names and data set name as in the two mean test, outcome name for the first in subtraction, number of repetitions, and the confidence level as a decimal.  Highlight and run lines 32 - 35. Report the 95\% confidence interval in interval notation.

```r
two_mean_bootstrap_CI(RESPONSE~EXPLANATORY, data = DATASET,  # Variables and data
                      first_in_subtraction = "xx", # First value in order of subtraction
                      number_repetitions = 1000,  # Number of simulations
                      confidence_level = xx)
```

\vspace{0.3in}

19. Interpret the interval you calculated in question 18. 

\vspace{1in}

#### Communicate the results and answer the research question {-}

20.  Write a paragraph summarizing the results of the study.  Be sure to describe:

* Summary statistic

* Confidence interval and interpretation

* Scope of inference

\vspace{3in}

#### Revisit and look forward {-}

21.  Would the results from the theory-based test match the results we saw with the simulation?  Explain why or why not.

\vspace{1in}

22. If we had data on 45 La Ni\latexcode{\~{n}}a years and 47 El Ni\latexcode{\~{n}}o years and found a similar summary statistic, what would happen to the p-value?  The width of the confidence interval?  The power of the test?

\vspace{1in}



### Out-of-class activity

The remaining questions cover inference for a difference in means using theory based methods.  Use section 6.3.3 in the textbook and the TwoMeanTheory video to complete the following questions.

The sampling distribution for $\bar{x}_1-\bar{x}_2$ can be modeled using a normal distribution when certain conditions are met.

Conditions for the sample distribution of $\bar{x}_1-\bar{x}_2$.

* Independence: The sampleâ€™s observations are independent

* Normality: each sample should be approximately normal

  + For each sample: 

    - $n < 30$: If the sample size n is less than 30 and there are no clear outliers in the data, then we typically assume the data come from a nearly normal distribution to satisfy the condition.

    - $n \le 30$: If the sample size n is at least 30 and there are no particularly extreme outliers, then we typically assume the sampling distribution of $\bar{x}$ is nearly normal, even if the underlying distribution of individual observations is not.

1.  In question 21 in the in-class activity we noted that there were issues with the normality condition.  Explain how that will affect the p-value and confidence interval found with theory-based methods.

\vspace{1in}

To find the Standardized Statistic for the difference in means we will calculate:

$$T = \frac{\bar{x}_1-\bar{x}_2}{SE(\bar{x}_1-\bar{x}_2)}$$

where the standard error of the difference in means is calculated using:

$$SE(\bar{x}_1 -\bar{x}_2)=\sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1}+\frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}$$
\newpage

2.  Calculate the standard error of the difference in means.

\vspace{0.5in}

3.  Calculate the standardized statistic for the difference in means.

\vspace{0.5in}

Using the provided `RScript` file, enter the T score (for xx) into the pt function using a df = minimum(n - 1) = 21 - 1 = 20, and lower.tail = TRUE to find the p-value.  Highlight and run line 39.


```r
2*pt(xx, df=20, lower.tail=TRUE)
```

4. Explain why we multiplied by 2 in the code above.

\vspace{0.3in}

5. Report the p-value from the `R` output.

\vspace{0.3in}

6.  Explain why the p-value found using theory-based methods from the p-value found using simulation methods in the in-class activity.

\vspace{0.5in}


To calculate the 95\% confidence interval use the formula:

$$\bar{x}_1- \bar{x}_2\pm t^* SE(\bar{x}_1- \bar{x}_2)$$

We will need to find the $t^*$ multiplier using the function qt.  For a 95% confidence interval we are finding the $t^*$ value at the 97.5th percentile with df = minimum(n - 1) = 21 - 1 = 20.


```
#> [1] 2.085963
```

7.  Calculate the 95\% confidence interval using theory-based methods.
