## Activity: Study Design

\setstretch{1}

### Learning outcomes

* Explain the purpose of random sampling and its effect on scope of inference.

* Explain the purpose of random assignment and its effect on scope of inference.

* Identify whether a study design is observational or an experiment.

* Identify confounding variables in observational studies and explain why they are confounding.

* Identify the types of bias present in a study.

### Terminology review

In this week's activity, we will examine different types of sampling bias and study designs, confounding variables, and how to determine the scope of inference for a study. Some terms covered in this activity are:

* Population

* Sample

* Parameter
    
* Statistic

* Selection bias

* Response bias

* Non-response bias

* Scope of inference

* Explanatory variable

* Response variable

* Confounding variable

* Experiment

* Observational study

To review these concepts, see Sections 1.3 through 1.6 in the textbook.  

### Study design
The two main study designs we will cover are **observational studies** and **experiments**.  Both the sampling method and the study design will help to determine the **scope of inference** for a study: To whom can we generalize, and can we conclude causation or only association?  Remember that only in a randomized experiment can we conclude a **causal** (cause and effect) relationship between the explanatory and response variable.

For the next exercises, identify the explanatory variable, the response variable, the study design (observational study or experiment), and the scope of inference (using the above chart).

5. The pharmaceutical company Moderna Therapeutics,  working in conjunction with the National Institutes of Health, conducted Phase 3 clinical trials towards a vaccine for COVID-19 last fall.  US clinical research sites enrolled 30,000 volunteers without COVID-19 to participate. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either the candidate vaccine or a saline placebo.  They were then followed to assess whether or not they developed COVID-19. The trial was double-blind, so neither the investigators nor the participants knew who was assigned to which group.

6. In another study, a local health department randomly selected 1000 US adults without COVID-19 to participate in a health survey.  Each participant was assessed at the beginning of the study and then followed for one year.  They were interested to see which participants elected to receive a vaccination for COVID-19 and whether any participants developed COVID-19.

A **confounding variable** is a variable that is _both_

1. associated with the explanatory variable, _and_
2. associated with the response variable.

When both these conditions are met, if we observe an association between the explanatory variable and the response variable in the data, we cannot be sure if this association is due to the explanatory variable or the confounding variable---the explanatory and confounding variables are "confounded."

arrows(0.67, 0.78, 0.8, 0.62,
       length = 0.08, lwd = 1.5)

arrows(0.5, 0.5, 0.69, 0.5,
       length = 0.08)
text(0.595, 0.565, "?",
     cex = 1.5)
par(par_og) # restore original par
```

7. For each of the studies in questions 5 and 6, determine whether confounding variables could be an issue. If so, identify a potential confounding variable and explain how it meets the definition of a confounding variable.
