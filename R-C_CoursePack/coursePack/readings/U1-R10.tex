{\bf {\large Experiments}}

In an {\bf experiment}, researchers {\bf assign treatments} to the
units.  They do not just observe what happens, but actually intervene
to make changes.

Often, a {\bf control group} is used which gets no treatment, or a
{\bf placebo} which is expected to produce no effect on the variable
of interest.
