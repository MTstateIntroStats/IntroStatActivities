ABSTRACT\\
\begin{quotation}
  Whereas human pro-social behavior is often driven by empathic concern
for another, it is unclear whether nonprimate mammals experience a
similar motivational state. To test for empathically motivated
pro-social behavior in rodents, we placed a free rat in an arena with
a cagemate trapped in a restrainer. After several sessions, the free
rat learned to intentionally and quickly open the restrainer and free
the cagemate. Rats did not open empty or object-containing
restrainers. They freed cagemates even when social contact was
prevented. When liberating a cagemate was pitted against chocolate
contained within a second restrainer, rats opened both restrainers and
typically shared the chocolate. Thus, rats behave pro-socially in
response to a conspecificâ€™s distress, providing strong evidence for
biological roots of empathically motivated helping behavior.
