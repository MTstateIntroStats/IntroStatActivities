## COVID-19 and Air Pollution

The social distancing efforts and stay-at-home directives to help combat the spread of COVID-19 have appeared to help 'flatten the curve' across the United States, albeit at a high cost to many individuals and businesses. The impact of these measures, though, goes far beyond the infection and death rates from the disease. You may have seen images comparing air quality in large international cities like Rome, Milan, Wuhan, and New Delhi such as the one pictured below which seem to indicate, perhaps unsurprisingly, that fewer people driving and factories being shut down have reduced air pollutants.

Have high population-density U.S. cities seen the same improved air quality conditions? To study this question, data was gathered from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) AirData website which records the ozone (O3) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) values for cities across the U.S. These measures are used to calculate an air quality index (AQI) score for each city each day of the year. Thirty-three of the most densely populated U.S. cities were selected and the AQI score recorded for April 20, 2020 as well as the five-year median AQI score for April 20th (2015 - 2019). Note that higher AQI scores indicate worse air quality.

| Current       | $\bar{x}_1$ = 47.394 | $s_1$ = 14.107     | $n_1$ = 33  |
| 5 Year Median | $\bar{x}_2$ = 51.545 | $s_2$ = 17.447     | $n_2$ = 33  |

## Use statistical inferential methods to draw inferences from the data

To simulate the null distribution we will use a bootstrapping method - sampling with replacement from the data set.  Before bootstrapping we will need to shift the each data point by the difference $\mu_0 - \bar{x}$.  This will ensure that the simulated null distribution will be centered at the null value.  

11. Calculate the difference $\mu_0 - \bar{x}$.  Will we need to shift the data up or down?
