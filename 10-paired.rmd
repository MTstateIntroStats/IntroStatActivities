### COVID-19 and air pollution

In June 2020, the social distancing efforts and stay-at-home directives to help combat the spread of COVID-19 appeared to help 'flatten the curve' across the United States, albeit at a high cost to many individuals and businesses. The impact of these measures, though, goes far beyond the infection and death rates from the disease. You may have seen images comparing air quality in large international cities like Rome, Milan, Wuhan, and New Delhi such as the one pictured in Figure \@ref(fig:covid), which seem to indicate, perhaps unsurprisingly, that fewer people driving and factories being shut down have reduced air pollutants. 

Have high population-density US cities seen the same improved air quality conditions? To study this question, data was gathered from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) AirData website which records the ozone (O3) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) values for cities across the U.S. These measures are used to calculate an air quality index (AQI) score for each city each day of the year. Thirty-three of the most densely populated US cities were selected and the AQI score recorded for April 20, 2020 as well as the five-year median AQI score for April 20th (2015--2019). Note that higher AQI scores indicate worse air quality. A box plot of the differences in AQI scores for the 33 cities and a table of summary statistics are shown below.

#### Use statistical inferential methods to draw inferences from the data {-}

To simulate the null distribution we will use a bootstrapping method.  Recall that the null distribution must be created under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true.  Therefore, before bootstrapping we will need to shift each data point by the difference $\mu_0 - \bar{x}$.  This will ensure that the mean of the shifted data is $\mu_0$ and that the simulated null distribution will be centered at the null value.  

12. Calculate the difference $\mu_0 - \bar{x}$.  Will we need to shift the data up or down?

    paired_test(data = Air$Difference,   # Vector of differences or data set with column for each group
            shift = xx,   # Shift needed for bootstrap hypothesis test
            as_extreme_as = yy,  # Observed statistic
            direction = "less",  # Direction of alternative

### Out-of-class activity

The remaining questions cover theory-based methods for testing paired quantitative data.  Use section 6.2.3 in the textbook and the OneMeanTheory video to complete the following questions.

The sampling distribution for $\bar{x}$ based on a sample of size $n$ from a population with a true mean $\mu$ and true standard deviation $\sigma$ can be modeled using a normal distribution when certain conditions are met.

Conditions for the sample distribution of $\bar{x}$.

* Independence: The sample’s observations are independent

* Normality: data should be approximately normal

    - n < 30: If the sample size n is less than 30 and there are no clear outliers in the data, then we typically assume the data come from a nearly normal distribution to satisfy the condition.

    - n ≥ 30: If the sample size n is at least 30 and there are no particularly extreme outliers, then we typically assume the sampling distribution of $\bar{x}$ is nearly normal, even if the underlying distribution of individual observations is not.

1.  In the in-class activity we verified that the independence condition was satisfied.  Is the normality condition met to use the theory-based methods for analysis?  Explain your answer.

\vspace{1in}

To find the standardized statistic for the paired differences we will use the following formula:

$$T = \frac{\bar{x}_d}{SE(\bar{x}_d)}$$

where the standard error of the mean difference is:

$$SE(\bar{x}_d)=\frac{s_d}{\sqrt{n}}$$

2.  Calculate the standard error of the mean difference.

\vspace{0.5in}

3.  Calculate the standardized statistic.

\vspace{0.5in}

Using the provided `RScript` file, enter the T score (for xx) into the pt function using a df = minimum(n - 1) = 33 - 1 = 32, and lower.tail = TRUE to find the p-value.  Highlight and run line 31.  

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
pt(xx, df=32, lower.tail=TRUE)
```

4.  Is the p-value found using theory-based methods similar to the simulation p-value found in the in-class activity?

\vspace{0.5in}


To calculate the 99\% confidence interval use the following formula:

$$\bar{x}_d\pm t^* SE(\bar{x}_d)$$

We will need to find the $t^*$ multiplier using the function qt. For a 99\% confidence interval we are finding the $t^*$ value at the 99.5th percentile with df = n - 1 = 33 - 1 = 32.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
qt(0.995, df = 32, lower.tail=TRUE)
```

5.  Calculate the 99\% confidence interval using theory-based methods.

\vspace{1in}

6.  Explain why the theory-based and simulation confidence intervals are not quite the same.

\vspace{1in}

### Take-home messages

1.	The differences in a paired data set is treated like a single quantitative variable when analyzing.  Paired data (or paired samples) occur when pairs of measurements are collected. We are only interested in the population (and sample) of differences, and not in the original data. 

2.  When using bootstrapping to create the null distribution centered at the null value for both paired data and a single quantitative variable we first need to shift the data by the difference, $\mu_0 - \bar{x}_d$ and then sample with replacement from the shifted data. 

3. When analyzing paired data the summary statistic is the mean difference NOT the difference in means.  This terminology will be *very* important in the interpretations.
