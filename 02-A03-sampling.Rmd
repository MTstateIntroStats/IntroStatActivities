### Native American Address

For this activity, you will read a speech given by Jim Becenti, a member of the Navajo American Indian tribe, who spoke about the employment problems his people faced at an Office of Indian Affairs meeting in Phoenix, Arizona, on January 30, 1947. His speech is below:

**It is hard for us to go outside the reservation where we meet strangers. I have been off the reservation ever since I was sixteen. Today I am sorry I quit the Santa Fe [Railroad]. I worked for them in 1912-13. You are enjoying life, liberty, and happiness on the soil the American Indian had, so it is your responsibility to give us a hand, brother. Take us out of distress. I have never been to vocational school. I have very little education. I look at the white man who is a skilled laborer. When I was a young man I worked for a man in Gallup as a carpenter’s helper. He treated me as his own brother. I used his tools. Then he took his tools and gave me a list of tools I should buy and I started carpentering just from what I had seen. We have no alphabetical language.**

**We see things with our eyes and can always remember it. I urge that we help my people to progress in skilled labor as well as common labor. The hope of my people is to change our ways and means in certain directions, so they can help you someday as taxpayers. If not, as you are going now, you will be burdened the rest of your life. The hope of my people is that you will continue to help so that we will be all over the United States and have a hand with you, and give us a brotherly hand so we will be happy as you are. Our reservation is awful small. We did not know the capacity of the range until the white man come and say “you raise too much sheep, got to go somewhere else,” resulting in reduction to a skeleton where the Indians can’t make a living on it. For eighty years we have been confused by the general public, and what is the condition of the Navajo today? Starvation! We are starving for education. Education is the main thing and the only thing that is going to make us able to compete with you great men here talking to us.**

#### By eye selection {-}

1. Circle ten words in Jim Becenti's speech which are a representative sample of the length of words in the entire text.  Describe your method for selecting this sample.

\vspace{0.5in}

2. Fill in the table below with your selected words from the preview assignment and the length of each word (number of letters/digits in the word):
\vspace{1mm}

```{r, fig.align = "center", out.width="50%", fig.cap=""}
include_graphics("images/word_length.png")
```

3.  Calculate the mean word length in your selected sample.  Is this value a parameter or a statistic?   
\vspace{0.3in}

4.  Report your mean word length to your instructor.  Your instructor will guide the class in creating a visualization of the distribution results generated by your class. Draw a picture of the plot here. Include a descriptive x-axis label.
\vspace{1.5in}

5. Based on the plot of sample mean word lengths in question 4, what is your best guess for the average word length of the population of all 359 words in the speech? 
\vspace{0.3in}

6. The true mean word length of the population of all 359 words in the speech is 3.95 letters. Is this value a parameter or a statistic?   
\vspace{0.2in}

\rgi Where does the value of 3.95 fall in our plot above?
\vspace{0.3in}

7. If your samples were truly representative, what proportion of sample means would you expect to be above 3.95?
\vspace{0.5in}

8.  What proportion of students’ computed sample means were larger than the true mean of 3.95 letters? 
\vspace{0.5in}

#### Random selection {-}

Suppose instead of selecting a representative sample by eye, each student used a random number generator to select a simple random sample of 10 words. A simple random sample relies on a random mechanism to choose a sample, without replacement, from the population, such that every sample of size 10 is equally likely to be chosen.

To use a random number generator to select a simple random sample, you first need a numbered list of all the words in the population, called a sampling frame. You can then generate 10 random numbers from the numbers 1 to 359 (the number of words in the population), and the chosen random numbers correspond to the chosen words in your sample.

9. Use the random number generator at https://istats.shinyapps.io/RandomNumbers/ and the sampling frame provided to select a simple random sample from the population of all 359 words in the speech. Fill in the table below with the random numbers selected and each number’s corresponding word and word length (number of letters/digits in the word):

```{r, fig.align = "center", out.width="50%", fig.cap=""}
include_graphics("images/random_word_length.png")
```

10. Calculate the mean word length in your selected sample in question 9. Is this value a parameter or a statistic?
\vspace{0.3in}

11. Report your mean word length to your instructor.  Your instructor will guide the class in creating a visualization of the distribution results generated by your class. Draw a picture of the plot here. Include a descriptive x-axis label.
\vspace{1.5in}

12.  Where does the value 3.95, the true mean word length, fall in the distribution created in question 11?
\vspace{0.3in}

13. How does the plot generated in question 11 compare to the plot generated in question 5? 

\rgi Which features are similar?  
\vspace{0.4in}

\rgi Which features differ? 

\vspace{0.4in}

\rgi Why didn’t everyone get the same sample mean?
\vspace{0.4in}

14. One set of randomly generated sample mean word lengths from a single class may not be large enough to visualize the distribution results. Let’s have a computer generate 1,000 sample mean word lengths for us.

*  Navigate to the “Sampling Distribution of the Sample Mean (Continuous Population)” Art of Stat web applet: https://istats.shinyapps.io/sampdist_cont/.

*  Under “Select Population Distribution”, select “Build Your Own”.

*  Copy and paste the population of word lengths into the applet from the data set provided.  **Only copy column 3 with NO header**. 

*  Select 10 for the sample size.

*  Select 1,000 for the number of samples to simulate drawing from the population.

*  Click “Draw Sample(s)”.

The plot labeled “Sampling Distribution of the Sample Mean” displays the 1,000 randomly generated sample mean word lengths. Sketch this plot below.
\vspace{1.5in}

15. What is the center value of this distribution created in question 14?
\vspace{0.3in}

16. Explain why the sampling method of using a random number generator to generate a sample is a "better" method than choosing 10 words “by eye”.
\vspace{0.8in}

17.  Which method of selection, "by eye" or random selection, is an unbiased method of selection?
\vspace{0.5in}

18. Explain why the human sampling method of choosing 10 words by eye is biased? What is the direction of the bias, i.e., does the method tend to overestimate or underestimate the population mean word length?
\vspace{0.8in}

### Take-home messages

1.	When we use a biased method of selection, we will over or underestimate the population mean.

2.	Random selection is an unbiased method of selection.

3. To see if a method is biased, we compare the distribution of the estimates
to the true value. We want our estimate to be on target or unbiased.  When using unbiased methods of selection, the mean of the distribution matches our true parameter.

4. If the sampling method is biased, inferences made about the population based on a sample estimate will not be valid. Random sampling avoids this problem.
