## Week 10 - Lab 8:  Diabetes

### Learning objectives

For this activity we will use a new data set. Researchers compared the efficacy of two treatment regimens to achieve durable glycemic control in children and adolescents with recent-onset type 2 diabetes.  A convenience sample of patients 10 to 17 years of age with recent-onset type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned to either a medication (rosiglitazone) or a lifestyle-intervention program focusing on weight loss through eating and activity.  Researchers measured whether the patient still needs insulin (failure) or had glycemic control (success).  Of the 233 children who received the Rosiglitazone treatment,143 had glycemic control, while of the 234 who went through the lifestyle-intervention program, 125 had glycemic control. Is there evidence that there is difference in proportion of patients that achieve durable glycemic control between the two treatments?  Use Rosiglitazone â€“ Lifestyle as the order of subtraction.

2. Complete the following two-way table using the data above.

|                         |     Rosiglitazone    |     Lifestyle    |     Total    |
|-------------------------|----------------------|------------------|--------------|
|     Glycemic Control    |                      |                  |              |
|     Insulin Required    |                      |                  |              |
|     Total               |                      |                  |              |

5.  Write the parameter of interest for this study in context of the problem.

To find a confidence interval for the difference in proportions we will add and subtract the margin of error from the point estimate to find the two endpoints.

 $$\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2\pm z^*SE(\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2), \hspace{.2cm} \text{where}$$
 $$SE(\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2) = \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}_1 (1-\hat{p}_1)}{n_1}+\frac{\hat{p}_2 (1-\hat{p}_2)}{n_2}}$$
 
Note that the formula changes when calculating the variability around the statistic in order to calculate a confidence interval from the formula used in Activity 19!  Here, we use the sample proportions for each group to calculate the standard error for the difference in proportions since we are not assuming that the true difference is zero.


6. Calculate the standard error for a difference in proportions to create a 95\% confidence interval.

7. Interpret the value calculated in question 5 in context of the problem.

\newpage
The $z^*$ multiplier is the percentile of a standard normal distribution that corresponds to our confidence level. If our confidence level is 90\%, we find the Z values that encompass the middle 90\% of the standard normal distribution. If 90\% of the standard normal distribution should be in the middle, that leaves 10\% in the tails, or 5\% in each tail.  The `qnorm()` function in `R` will tell us the $z^*$ value for the desired percentile (in this case, 90\% + 5\% = 95\% percentile). 

```{r, echo=TRUE, collapse=FALSE}
qnorm(0.95) # Multiplier for 90% confidence interval
```

8. Sketch a graph of the standard normal distribution and use the graph to explain how the `R` code above is used to find the $z^*$ multiplier.

9. Using the multiplier of $z^*$ = 1.645 and the standard error found in question 5, calculate the margin of error for a 90\% confidence interval.

### Effect of sample size 

Suppose in another sample of children and adolescents we saw these results:

|                         |     Rosiglitazone    |     Lifestyle    |     Total    |
|-------------------------|----------------------|------------------|--------------|
|     Glycemic Control    |          72          |        62        |      134     |
|     Insulin Required    |          45          |        55        |      100     |
|     Total               |          117         |        117       |      234     |

12.  Calculate the margin of error for a 95\% confidence interval using a multiplier of $z^*$ = 1.96 for this new sample.  Is the margin of error larger or smaller than the margin of error for the original study?

13.  Calculate the 95\% confidence interval for this new study using the margin of error from question 12.

15.  Is the confidence interval calculated in question 13 with the smaller sample size wider or smaller than the confidence interval in question 10? Why?
