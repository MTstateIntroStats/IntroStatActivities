### What does *confidence* mean?

In the interpretation of a 95\% confidence interval, we say that we are 95\% confident that the parameter is within the confidence interval.  Why are we able to make that claim?  What does it mean to say "we are 95\% confident"?

### Out-of-class activity

The in-class activity covered simulation-based methods for confidence intervals involving a single categorical variable. The remaining questions cover theory-based methods for estimating a single proportion.  Use Section 5.3.3 in the textbook and the OnePropTheory video to complete the following questions.

Recall that to use theory-based methods we must check the conditions to approximate the sampling distribution with the normal distribution.  From the previous activity, we saw that independence was satisfied as the researchers took a random sample.

To check the success-failure condition to use theory-based methods for confidence intervals, we use $\hat{p}$ in the calculations since we are not assuming a value for $\pi$. That is, check that we have at least 10 successes and 10 failures in our **sample**:  $n\hat{p} \geq 0$  and $n(1-\hat{p}) \geq 10$.

1.  Verify that the success-failure condition is met to use theory based methods to find a 95\% confidence interval.

To calculate a theory-based 95\% confidence interval for $\pi$, we will first find the **standard error** of $\hat{p}$ by plugging in the value of $\hat{p}$ for $\pi$ in $SD(\hat{p})$:

$$SE(\hat{p}) = \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}}.$$
Note that we do not include a "0" subscript, since we are not assuming a null hypothesis. 

2.  Calculate the standard error of the sample proportion to find a 95\% confidence interval.

\vspace{0.5in}


To find the confidence interval, we will add and subtract the **margin of error** to the point estimate:

$$\text{point estimate}\pm\text{margin of error}$$
$$\hat{p}\pm z^* SE(\hat{p})$$

The $z^*$ multiplier is the percentile of a standard normal distribution that corresponds to our confidence level. If our confidence level is 95\%, we find the Z values that encompass the middle 95\% of the standard normal distribution.  If 95\% of the standard normal distribution should be in the middle, that leaves 5\% in the tails, or 2.5\% in each tail.  The `qnorm()` function in `R` will tell us the $z^*$ value for the desired percentile (in this case, 95\% + 2.5\% = 97.5\% percentile). 

```{r, echo=TRUE, collapse=FALSE}
qnorm(0.975) # Multiplier for 95% confidence interval
```

3. Using the multiplier of $z^*$ = 1.96, calculate the 95\% confidence interval for the true proportion of male boxers who are left-handed.

4.  Verify that the simulation-based confidence interval found using bootstrapping is similar to the confidence interval calculating using theory-based methods.
